1," Chilean primary healthcare practice is analyzed using a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) multiple stage approach. We estimate the efficiency level of 259 municipalities nationwide. Since the efficiency score by itself is of limited value for decision making, we use a multivariate tool to help explain the effect of relevant factors. First, we use a cluster analysis to homogenize the units under study. Second, we use DEA to estimate the efficiency levels, which varies from 61% to 71% for urban municipalities, and from 51% to 56% in rural ones. Third, we use bootstrap to estimate confidence intervals for the efficiency scores, and a Biplot method to identify adequate variables to include in the Tobit Model, which is our last stage. We identify six factors associated with rural municipalities’ operational efficiency, and two with urban ones. Knowing the efficiency level of municipalities can help determine ways to improve…"
1,"Attempting to deepen the understanding of factors that explain student performance, this study seeks to identify and characterize profiles of Chilean students based on academic performance in mathematics. As analytical method, statistical techniques known as random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) were used to identify groups of eighth-grade elementary students according to their performance in 2011 test, using features related to individual and family behavior. The analysis was performed with a database provided by the Education Quality Measurement System of Chile. Results show that “parents’ educational expectations” (42.7%) is key factor to obtain the best children's performances. Additionally, the analysis showed that the “type of school” (26.6%) and the “index of mathematical abilities” (26.1%) influence good performance."
1,"The export of fresh blueberries is an important productive activity in Chile, in terms of the labour employed, the number of hectares cultivated and the resulting trade flow with the northern hemisphere. The export of fresh blueberries requires planning based on early estimates of the yield of the orchard. The growers keep plots with plants of more or less the same age and variety; thus, it is possible to estimate the yield of the whole orchard, based on the yield per plant. Two factors must be considered in estimating the yield per plant: the number of fruits and their fresh weight. An early estimate of the number of fruits can be based on the number of flower buds and their viability during flowering and fruit development. The aim of the research was to find a way of estimating plant yields in commercial orchards by proposing models which relate the number of fruits available for harvest to the number of flower buds and to …"
1,"The initial microflora of minimally processed celery and cabbage packaged under a modified atmosphere was determined. The samples came from the same producer and were sold in a supermarket chain of Santiago, Chile. Although neither E. coli nor Salmonella spp. were detected, initial total plate and Enterobacteriaceae counts were high (≥ 105 cfu/g), not meeting in most cases the specifications of the Chilean legislation. The D10 value for two strains of E. coli (ATCC 8739 and a wild type) inoculated as indicator microorganisms was determined. After irradiating with 5 D10 doses (1kGy), the variation of the microbial population and sensory quality during a 7 days storage period at 5ºC was studied. In irradiated celery, a reduction of 4.7 and 3.8 logs for total plate and Enterobacteriaceae counts respectively was observed. There was a decrease of 3.8 and 3.6 logs in cabbage for total plate and Enterobacteriaceae counts respectively. In both irradiated and non-irradiated vegetables, neither E. coli nor Salmonella spp. were detected. An increase of 1.6 - 1.7 logs in both microbiological parameters in non-irradiated samples was observed during storage. In irradiated products, only celery showed an increase of 1.2 log in total plate count. Both Enterobacteriaceae count in the two vegetables and Total plate count in cabbage presented essentially no variation in time. No significant differences (p ≥0.05) were detected in sensory total quality between the control and the irradiated vegetable and between days of storage."
1,"In the context of multidimensional structures, with the presence of a common factor and multiple specific or group factors, estimates of reliability require specific estimators. The use of classical procedures such as the alpha coefficient or omega total that ignore structural complexity are not appropriate, since they can lead to strongly biased estimates. Through a simulation study, the bias of six estimators of reliability in multidimensional measures was evaluated and compared. The study is complemented by an empirical illustration that exemplifies the procedure. Results showed that the estimators with the lowest bias in the estimation of the total reliability parameter are omega total, the two versions of Greatest Lower Bound (GLB) and the alpha coefficient, which in turn are also those that produce the highest overestimation of the reliability of the general factor. Nevertheless, the most appropriate estimators, in that they produce less biased estimates of the reliability parameter of the general factor, are omega limit and omega hierarchical."
1,"Nowadays, people spend long periods on social media, ignoring the implications this carries in daily life. In this context, the concept of social media literacy, an emerging concept scarcely developed in the literature, is relevant. This study sought to analyze, descriptively, the main definitions and competences of the concept of social media literacy. The methodology included a systematic search of literature in the databases Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus between 2010 and 2021, applying filters for English and Spanish, including only scientific articles. A total of 1093 articles were obtained. An article selection process took place, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in a total of 15 articles being selected. The findings indicate that the concept of social media literacy is based on media literacy to then integrate the characteristics and the implications of digital platforms. This is linked to the development of cognitive competences, where critical thinking, socio-emotional competences, and technical competences are fundamental, considering the social context. The development of socio-emotional competences stands out since social media are a frequent place of interaction between people."
1,"Background: Among other negative effects, herbicides induce oxidative stress, leading to lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. Therefore, there is a growing need to identify natural compounds with sufficient antioxidant capacity and mitigate the negative effects of herbicides without side effects.Objective: Our study aimed to examine the protective effect of the phenolic extract of wild garlic (WG) leaves on terbuthylazine-treated erythrocytes.Material and methods: In human erythrocytes treated with the herbicide terbuthylazine (4.5 mg/L) alone and a combination of terbuthylazine and WG extract, we measured malondialdehyde (MDA) and haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and the antioxidant activities of CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD1; EC 1.15.1.1) and catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) in vitro.Results: In comparison with terbuthylazine, WG extract reduced the concentrations of MDA and Hb from 59.69 to 43.45 …"
1,"Seasonal variations in the environment (e.g. of temperature and light    intensity) can lead to the excess production of reactive oxygen species and    oxidative stress, inducing changes in the permeability of the plant cell    membrane and the structure and function of cellular molecules. To address    these deleterious effects, plants activate various non-enzymatic and    enzymatic antioxidants. This study seeks to detect the influence of seasonal    variation in Hedera helix (ivy) leaves, collected in Banj brdo (Banja Luka,    Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina) between December 2017 and November    2018, on oxidative (hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde) and antioxidant    (superoxide dismutase, catalase, Class III peroxidases, and phenolic    compounds) parameters. During the winter-early spring months (a temperature    range of 0.7 to 5.4°C), we detected an increase in the values of all the    oxidative and antioxidant parameters, whereas during the spring, summer, and    autumn months (a temperature range of 15 to 25°C), the values of most of    these parameters fell. However, a peak in the parameter values was detected    during June and July 2018, which might be attributable to the influence of    the changes in both light intensity and temperature and to the effects of    intensive shoot growth. Our results highlight the importance of the    antioxidant protection system of H. helix for its acclimation to seasonal    variations in the environment, especially temperature."
1,"The object of this paper is to prove some general results about rational idempotents for a finite group G and deduce from them geometric information about the components that appear in the decomposition of the Jacobian variety of a curve with G-action. We give an algorithm to find explicit primitive rational idempotents for any G, as well as for rational projectors invariant under any given subgroup. These explicit constructions allow geometric descriptions of the factors appearing in the decomposition of a Jacobian with group action: from them we deduce the decomposition of any Prym or Jacobian variety of an intermediate cover, in the case of a Jacobian with G-action. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a Prym variety of an intermediate cover to be such a factor."

1,"In genus four there is only one Riemann surface admitting the symmetric group of order five as group of automorphisms: we compute its Riemann matrix. On the other hand, we show that there is a one complex parameter family of Jacobians admitting the same group of automorphisms and using the Schottky relation we give a non-trivial equation vanishing exactly on the matrix of the surface."

1,"1. Introduction. Let M be a compact Riemann surface and J (M) its Jacobi variety obtained from the surface via the matrix of periods of abelian differentials. A very puzzling problem is that of the determination of the surfaces which admit a maximal group of automorphisms, maximal in the sense that the surfaces have zero moduli. The interest arises on the one hand because one may hope for an explicit computation ofJ (M) in these cases and on the other hand because they give points where the moduli space can be singular. The surfaces with a cyclic group of automorphisms are of special significance and were studied by Scorza, Lefschetz, and Weil among others, all ofwhom obtained partial results. The purpose of this paper is to present the complete solution to this problem. Before goinginto the details however, we will give a brief sketch of its history."

1,"This book is intended for a graduate course on complex analysis, also known as function theory. The main focus is the theory of complex-valued functions of a single complex variable. This theory is a prerequisite for the study of many current and rapidly developing areas of mathematics including the theory of several and infinitely many complex variables, the theory of groups, hyperbolic geometry and three-manifolds, and number theory. Complex analysis has connections and applications to many other subjects in mathematics and to other sciences. It is an area where the classic and the modern techniques meet and benefit from each other. This material should be part of the education of every practicing mathematician, and it will also be of interest to computer scientists, physicists, and engineers.The first part of the book is a study of the many equivalent ways of understanding the concept of analyticity.

1,"We describe the isotypical decomposition of the Jacobian variety JW of the Galois extension W-->T of any fourfold cover of smooth connected irreducible projective complex curves X-->T, in terms of Prym's of intermediate covers. We also compute the degree of the isogenies involved and as a result we obtain new proofs of the bigonal and trigonal constructions. Furthermore, we give examples of families of Jacobians isogenous to a product of Jacobians and of families of Prym varieties isogenous to the product of elliptic curves."
1,"We prove that given a finite group G together with a set of fixed geometric generators, there is a family of special hyperbolic polygons that uniformize the Riemann surfaces admitting the action of G with the given geometric generators. From these special polygons, we obtain geometric information for the action: a basis for the homology group of surfaces, its intersection matrix, and the action of the given generators of G on this basis. We then use the Frobenius algorithm to obtain a symplectic representation G of G corresponding to this action. The fixed point set of G in the Siegel upper half-space corresponds to a component of the singular locus of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties. We also describe an implementation of the algorithm using the open source computer algebra system SAGE."

1,"In several papers written in the years 1884-1909, cf.[6], Henri Poincar6 studied special cases of Riemann surfaces with automorphisms pursuing the relations that appear between polygons in non-euclidean geometry, Riemann matrices and the equations of curves in projective plane.Nevertheless in this extensive survey some of the proofs remain unclear and this leads into doubtful results. To be precise we present here one of such conclusions that motivates the rest of this paper. Consider a Riemann surface of genus three that admits an automorphism of order two; the surface is given by a non-singular curve C of degree four in the complex projective plane. Poincar6's argument then runs as follows: The quotient by the involution is a curve D of degree four with a single ordinary double point P. The lines through P cut D at two points that come in pairs from the intersections of lines with C. Since there are six …"

1,"We construct and study two series of curves whose Jacobians admit complex multiplication. The curves arise as quotients of Galois coverings of the projective line with Galois group metacyclic groups  of order  with  an odd prime, and  of order . The complex multiplications arise as quotients of double coset algebras of the Galois groups of these coverings. We work out the CM-types and show that the Jacobians are simple abelian varieties.

1,"In “On Schottky-type … I”, we embedded ST (s,t), the Schottky-type space of type (s,t) with p = s + t.

Finally, we study the boundary of ST ∗, and conclude that it contains Kleinian groups of the first kind, cusps, non-discrete groups, and the Riemann surfaces with at most 3p - 3 nodes obtained by pinching a compact Riemann surface of genus p along a system of at most p non-dividing curves and at most 2p - 3 dividing curves."
1,"Let G denote a finite group, with M C N C G subgroups. If G acts on an algebraic curve W as a group of automorphisms, then the isotypical decomposition of JW with respect to the given G-action carries over to the intermediate Prym variety P (W/M–W/N). It may well happen that two such Prym varieties have the same decomposition and are therefore isogenous, without the corresponding pairs of subgroups being conjugate in G. We show that such a case appears when G is the dihedral group of order eight; we compute the degree of this natural isogeny, and obtain the bigonal construction as a special case."
1,"A closed Riemann surface S is a generalized Fermat curve of type (k,n) if it admits a group of automorphisms H≅Zkn such that the quotient O=S/H is an orbifold with signature (0,n+1;k,…,k), that is, the Riemann sphere with (n+1) conical points, all of same order k. The group H is called a generalized Fermat group of type (k,n) and the pair (S,H) is called a generalized Fermat pair of type (k,n). We study some of the properties of generalized Fermat curves and, in particular, we provide simple algebraic curve realization of a generalized Fermat pair (S,H) in a lower-dimensional projective space than the usual canonical curve of S so that the normalizer of H in Aut(S) is still linear.

1," The known examples of explicit equations for Riemann surfaces whose field of moduli is different from their field of definition, are all hyperelliptic. In this paper we construct a family of equations for non-hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces, each of them is isomorphic to its conjugate Riemann surface, but none of them admit an anticonformal automorphism of order 2; that is, each of them has its field of moduli, but not a field of definition, contained in  .

We obtain necessary conditions, called Condition (A), on the set of fixed points of the non-trivial elements of H in order to find a Schottky uniformization as desired. For instance, Condition (A) is trivially satisfied by groups acting freely, groups isomorphic to Z/2Z⊕···⊕ Z/2Z and dihedral groups.

1,"A closed Riemann surface of genus at least 2 can be described by many different objects, for instance, by algebraic curves and by torsion-free co-compact Fuchsian groups. If a torsion-free co-compact Fuchsian group is provided, then in general it is a difficult task to obtain an algebraic curve describing the surface uniformized by the given Fuchsian group. We consider those closed Riemann surfaces appearing as a maximal Abelian cover of an orbifold; called homology closed Riemann surfaces. These surfaces are uniformized by the (torsion-free) derived subgroup of certain co-compact Fuchsian groups of genus zero.

We observe that H is of Schottky type if and only if it leaves invariant a collection of pairwise disjoint simple loops which disconnect S into genus zero surfaces. Moreover, in the case that H is a cyclic group (either generated by a conformal or an anticonformal automorphism) we provide a simple to check necessary and sufficient condition in order for it to be of Schottky type."

We then show that every Schottky group in an appropriately defined relative conical neighborhood of any sufficiently complicated noded Schottky group is necessarily non-classical.

1,"The determination of the full group of automorphisms of a closed Riemann surface is in general a very complicated task. For hyperelliptic curves, the uniqueness of the hyperelliptic involution permits one to compute these groups in a very simple manner. Similarly, as classical Fermat curves of degree k admit a unique subgroup of automorphisms isomorphic to Zk2, the determination of the group of automorphisms is not difficult. In this paper we consider a family of non-hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces, obtained as the fibre product of two classical Fermat curves of the same degree k, which exhibit behaviors of both elliptic and hyperelliptic curves. These curves, called generalized Fermat curves of type (k,3), are the highest regular abelian branched covers of orbifolds of genus zero with four cone points, all of the same order k. More precisely, a generalized Fermat curve of type (k,3) is a closed Riemann surface S …"
1,"We introduce coordinates, given by fixed points, for the marked Schottky space Sg of genus g ⩾ 2. With these coordinates, different to the ones given by Bers, Sato and Gerritzen, we can think of the space Sg as an open subset of C×C3g−4. A partial closure of Sg, denoted by NSg and called the marked noded Schottky space of genus g, is considered. Each point in NSg corresponds to a geometrically finite free group of rank g, called a (marked) noded Schottky group of genus g, Conversely, each such group corresponds to a point in NSg. We have that each noded Schottky group of genus g uniformizes a stable Riemann surface of genus g. Moreover, we show that every stable Riemann surface is uniformized by such a group (retrosection theorem with nodes)."

As a consequence, we obtain that finitely generated function groups satisfy such a property. We also show that geometrically finite Kleinian groups satisfy the MEFP property. Examples of Kleinian groups where such a property does not hold are provided."

While a lot of work has been done by many authors to determine which hyperelliptic curves are defined over their field of moduli, less is known for superelliptic curves.In this paper we observe that if the reduced group of a genus g≥ 2 superelliptic curve X is different from the trivial or cyclic group, then X can be defined over its field of moduli; in the cyclic situation we provide a sufficient condition for this to happen. We also determine those families of superelliptic curves of genus at most 10 which might not be definable over their field of moduli."

1,"revised July 27, 1992) Abstract. We extend a result on homology coverings of closed Riemann surfaces due to Maskit [1] to the class of analytically finite ones. We show that if S is an analytically finite hyperbolic Riemann surface, then its conformal structure is determined by the conformal structure of its homology cover. The homology cover of a Riemann surface S is the highest regular covering of S with an Abelian group of covering transformations. In fact, we show that the commutator subgroup of any torsion-free, finitely generated Fuchsian group of the first kind determines it uniquely."

2,"With the fast growth of the Latin America electronic commerce (e-Commerce), it is indispensable to design effective websites. Evaluating usability issues allows improving the design. One popular method for detecting usability problems is the heuristic evaluation, in which evaluators employ a set of usability heuristics as a guide. Using proper heuristics is highly relevant. In this paper, we present a set of 12 cultural-oriented usability heuristics, developed iteratively, and validated, in their final step, on e-Commerce websites. The evidence supports our argument that websites which display characteristics relevant to specific issues of the four Hofstede's cultural dimensions improve their usability."

2," Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined as persistent difficulty in maturing the socialization process. Health professionals have used traditional methods in the therapies performed on patients with the aim of improving the expression of emotions by patients. However, they have not been sufficient to detect the different emotions expressed in the face of people according to different sensations. Therefore, different artificial intelligence techniques have been applied to improve the results obtained in these therapies. In this article, we propose the construction of an intelligent mirror to recognize five basic emotions: angry, scared, sad, happy and neutral. This mirror uses convolutional neural networks to analyze the images that are captured by a camera and compare it with the one that the patient should perform, thus supporting the therapies performed by health professionals in …"

2,"While some areas of software engineering knowledge present great advances with respect to the automation of processes, tools, and practices, areas such as software maintenance have scarcely been addressed by either industry or academia, thus delegating the solution of technical tasks or human capital to manual or semiautomatic forms. In this context, machine learning (ML) techniques play an important role when it comes to improving maintenance processes and automation practices that can accelerate delegated but highly critical stages when the software launches. The aim of this article is to gain a global understanding of the state of ML-based software maintenance by using the compilation, classification, and analysis of a set of studies related to the topic. The study was conducted by applying a systematic mapping study protocol, which was characterized by the use of a set of stages that strengthen its replicability. The review identified a total of 3776 research articles that were subjected to four filtering stages, ultimately selecting 81 articles that were analyzed thematically. The results reveal an abundance of proposals that use neural networks applied to preventive maintenance and case studies that incorporate ML in subjects of maintenance management and management of the people who carry out these tasks. In the same way, a significant number of studies lack the minimum characteristics of replicability."
2," Given the nature of the elements that make up blood, microscopes are fundamental to identifying blood cell morphology. These instruments are expensive and limited, and it is difficult to keep blood samples and their diversity in educational environments. We propose a solution based on virtual reality, that generates reliable blood samples using the automatic creation of images that simulate specific pathologies. We validated the proposal in three aspects: A method of adoption model, the validation of replicated samples and a performance test. The study and subsequent development of the mobile application were able to generate simulations of samples corresponding to a healthy adult and an adult with acute myeloid leukemia, where users can visualize, explore and obtain data on each of the elements that appear in the sample. This iteration not only verifies its technical feasibility but opens the way for future …"
2," This research analyzes self-reported methods for user satisfaction evaluation through science mapping. The focal point of the domain fields of a user satisfaction evaluation must be fully established according to the current reality (challenges, issues and gaps) and future scientific perspectives (patterns and trends). The foregoing motivates the authors of the present article to use tools such as SciMAT to analyze the bibliographical production on user satisfaction and to identify the thematic patterns related to the user experience of particular interest in this study, such as self-reported methods, specifically SUS, SUMI and QUIS. Self-reported methods are the most frequently used evaluation tools due to their simplicity and low cost.

2," The rise of systems for smart cities has led to an increase in the incorporation of air quality monitoring and alert systems. However, evidence on the real impact of these initiatives on city-dwellers is still far from conclusive. Recent investigations stress the importance of early user involvement in the appropriation of proposed solutions; this article shows how an approach through product design can support the development and successful implementation of the mobile application AIRE implemented in the context of the SmartArucanía smart city project, from the perspective of iterative design and exploration focusing on citizen participation. The product design process involved three interventions: (i) a market benchmark – presenting the basic principles of functionality and aesthetics adopted by the market; (ii) a heuristic evaluation – evaluating the initial development proposal and identifying preliminary problems with …"
2,"Computer programming has become an increasingly cross-cutting theme and is no longer considered just a specialized subject. In some countries, the inclusion of this subject in the curricula of the basic cycles of their educational systems has been provided for, because it is recognized that programming promotes computational thinking which allows cognitive development of students. In Chile, the Universidad de La Frontera established that an initial programming course is given to all the Engineering degrees. Unfortunately, studies have shown that students are not achieving the competencies defined by the computational thinking approach. This research paper presents a flexible and systematic teaching framework for developing cognitive skills in programming courses. This framework considers the use of a systematic methodology of teaching programming, which focuses on the process of building solutions …"
2,"Complexity in modern radiotherapy treatments demands advanced dosimetry systems for quality control. These systems must have several characteristics, such as high spatial resolution, tissue equivalence, three-dimensional resolution, and dose-integrating capabilities. In this scenario, gel dosimetry has proved to be a very promising option for quality assurance. In this study, the feasibility of Fricke and polymer gel dosimeters suitably shaped in form of thin layers and optically analyzed by visible light transmission imaging has been investigated for quality assurance in external radiotherapy. Dosimeter irradiation was carried out with a 6-MV photon beam (CLINAC 600C). The analysis of the irradiated dosimeters was done using two-dimensional optical transmission images. These dosimeters were compared with a treatment plan system using Monte Carlo simulations as a reference by means of a gamma test with …"

This work presents the development and characterization of an improved Fricke gel system, based on modified chemical compositions, making possible its application in clinical radiology due to its improved sensitivity. Properties of standard Fricke gel dosimeter for high‐dose levels are used as a starting point, and suitable chemical modifications are introduced and carefully investigated in order to attain high resolution for low‐dose ranges, like those corresponding to radiology interventions.

It consists of a small X‐ray tube and a Silicon Drift Detector, both controlled by a homemade software. The spatial resolution is evaluated as a function of the step width and of the X‐ray collimator diameter. The time of acquisition per unit of scanned surface is studied as a function of the step width and of the time of acquisition per point. X‐ray fluorescence images showing the 2D distributions of some elements in biological samples are presented. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
2,"Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) imaging systems are of great interest in many applications of different areas, once they allow us to get images of the spatial elemental distribution in the samples. The detector system used in this study is based on a micro patterned gas detector, named Micro-Hole and Strip Plate.

2,"This study examines the increase in the capacity to detect gold nanoparticles in tumor tissue using X-rays from orthovoltage sources. The analyzed methodology considered aspects of geometry and composition in accordance with those required in real clinical treatment applications. The results show that a geometrical backscatter configuration, an incident spectral energy synthesized to optimize statistical parameters and adequate background subtraction allow for a significant increase in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the secondary Kβ lines. This increase is greater than those currently reported for traditional Kα lines. Furthermore, these conditions also produce an increase in detection sensitivity, less uncertainty in results and shorter exposure times. The proposed methodology was evaluated using XMI-MSIM software for the Monte Carlo simulation fluorescent response of each element. The simulation used …"
2,"This work reports the experimental development of an integral Gd-infused dosimeter suitable for Gd dose enhancement assessment along with Monte Carlo simulations applied to determine the dose enhancement by radioactive and X-ray sources of interest in conventional and electronic brachytherapy. In this context, capability to elaborate a stable and reliable Gd-infused dosimeter was the first goal aimed at direct and accurate measurements of dose enhancement due to Gd presence. Dose-response was characterized for standard and Gd-infused PAGAT polymer gel dosimeters by means of optical transmission/absorbance. The developed Gd-infused PAGAT dosimeters demonstrated to be stable presenting similar dose-response as standard PAGAT within a linear trend up to 13 Gy along with good post-irradiation readout stability verified at 24 and 48 h. Additionally, dose enhancement was evaluated for Gd …"
2,"In this paper the configuration of an Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) system optimized for in vivo quantification of gadolinium in tumor tissue was studied. The system was configured using XMI-MSIM software designed to predict the XRF spectral response using Monte Carlo simulations. The studied setup is comprised of an X-ray tube, tuned to different voltages, and a copper filter system configured with variable thickness, which emits a spectrally narrow beam centered on the specific excitation energy. The values for the central energy excitation and the spectral width were adjusted to optimize the system, using like figures of merit: minimization of the limit of detection, measurement uncertainty and radiation exposure. These values were obtained in two stages. The first was successive simulations of incident spectra with central energy in the range of 50–70 keV. The second was comprised of …"

We have denominated it Convergent Beam Radio Therapy (CBRT). Analytical methods are developed first in order to determine the dosimetry characteristic of an ideal convergent photon beam in a hypothetical water phantom. Then, using the PENELOPE Monte Carlo code, a similar convergent beam that is applied to the water phantom is compared with that of the analytical method."
2,"This paper presents the results of a new technique for in vivo energy dispersive X‐ray fluorescence (EDXRF) scan analysis, applied to human fingernails. The scan employs a specially designed EDXRF spectrometer, which allows a concentration profile of the elements detected in a human nail. In order to carry out this technique, a group of nail fragments taken from different people was analyzed. The elements S, Ca, Cu, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb were detected in most of the samples. A bidimensional (x, y) scan was also performed on a whole removed nail in which the 2D spatial distribution of the detected elements was observed. Significant differences in some of the detected elements were noted. Minimum time of average detection per element was determined, based on the EDXRF spectra of the nail fragment. The time required to obtain an in vivo element profile of a typical nail was thus determined, applying the …"
2,"Different kinds of nanoparticles have been widely studied for biomedical purposes, including applications like dose enhancement in radiotherapy treatments and contrast agent in radiological studies. Recent work suggests that gold nanoparticles can be used as contrast agents in K-edge imaging and X-ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography, mainly due to their high K-edge energy value and good biocompatibility. However, the gold X-ray fluorescence (XRF) signal obtained in these procedures is relatively week when compared with Compton or bremsstrahlung radiation emitted in the surrounding tissues, mainly because it is not possible to achieve large gold nanoparticles concentrations within biological tissues added to the XRF is attenuated by other tissues when leaving the patient body.This work presents a feasibility study on implementation of FLUKA, PENELOPE and MCNP6 Monte Carlo codes to model …"
2,"In this work, the response of the VARIAN® PaxScan 2020+ flat panel detector was characterized in terms of spatial resolution and uniformity across the detection area along with detection efficiency for photon beams from conventional X‐ray tubes. This information is not commonly provided by the manufacturer. The characterization of spatial resolution, response uniformity and the detection efficiency of the VARIAN® PaxScan 2020+ are a crucial key for improving imaging procedures with diagnostic purposes, mainly when quantification by image processing is required. According to the obtained results, the VARIAN® PaxScan 2020+ detector has, on average, a spatial uniformity, considered as detector response corresponding to different positions for a fixed excitation beam, of 77% measured across the whole detection area 19.8×19.8 cm2; whereas the minimum size measurable is (357 ± 14) μm.

2,"The present work is devoted to optimizing the sensitivity-doses relationship of a bench-top EDXRF system, with the aim of achieving a detection limit of 0.010 mg/ml of gold nanoparticles in tumor tissue (clinical values expected), for doses below 10 mGy (value fixed for in vivo application). Tumor phantoms of 0.3 cm3 made of a suspension of gold nanoparticles (15 nm AurovistTM, Nanoprobes Inc.) were studied at depths of 0–4 mm in a tissue equivalent cylindrical phantom. The optimization process was implemented configuring several tube voltages and aluminum filters, to obtain non-symmetrical narrow spectra with fixed FWHM of 5 keV and centered among the 11.2–20.3 keV. The used statistical figure of merit was the obtained sensitivity (with each spectrum at each depth) weighted by the delivered surface doses. The detection limit of the system was determined measuring several gold nanoparticles …"
2,"Visualization of elemental distributions of biological tissue is gaining importance in many disciplines of biological, forensic, and medical research. Furthermore, the maps of elements have wide application in archeology for the understanding of the pigments, modes of preservation and environmental context. Since major advances in relation to collimators and detectors have yielded micro scale images, the chemical mapping via synchrotron scanning micro-X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (SR-µXRF) is widely used as microanalytical techniques. However, the acquisition time is a limitation of current SR-µXRF imaging protocols, doing tedious micro analysis of samples of more than 1 cm and very difficult to study of larger samples such as animal organ, whole organisms, work of art, etc. Recently we have developed a robotic system to image the chemistry of large specimens rapidly at concentration levels of parts per million. Multiple images of distribution of elements can be obtained on surfaces of 100x100 mm and a spatial resolution of up to 0.2 mm² per pixel, with a spectral capture time up to 1 ms per point. This system has proven to be highly efficient for the XRF mapping of elements in large biological samples, achieving comparables results to those obtained by SR-µXRF. Thus, images of As and Cu accumulation in renal cortex of arsenic-exposed rats were obtained by both methodologies. However, the new imaging system enables the XRF scanning in few minutes, whereas SR-µXRF required several hours. These and other advantages as well as the potential applications of this system, will be discussed."
2,"The L shell fluorescence cross-sections of the elements in range 45/Z/50 have been determined at 8 keV using Synchrotron radiation. The individual L X-ray photons, Ll, Lα, LβI, LβII, LγI and LγII produced in the target were measured with high resolution Si(Li) detector. The experimental set-up provided a low background by using linearly polarized monoenergetic photon beam, improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The experimental cross-sections obtained in this work were compared with available experimental data from Scofield [1], [2] Krause [3], [4] and Scofield and Puri et al. [5], [6].These experimental values closely agree with the theoretical values calculated using Scofield and Krause data, except for the case of Lγ, where values measured of this work are slighter higher."
2," This paper proposes a spectrometric method for x‐ray fluorescence, based on selective excitation and integral counting of the emitted photons by the sample. It is named SEICXRF (Selective Excitation and Integral Counting of X‐Ray Fluorescence). The general characteristics of the method are shown: the spectrometer, the spectrum acquisition, the effects involved in the determination of the jump intensity and their respective algorithms (the primary and secondary intensities and other unexpected effects), its capacity to identify elements, its sensitivity, its limitations and scope.

2,"XRF nondestructive sample analysis is very convenient when applied to samples that should not be altered, for example, works of art or archeological pieces. When one has various similar samples of this characteristic, a good sample comparison method is necessary. There are various comparison methods among which the three component graphic representation allows a comparison in a throe element component. In an XRF analysis, a large number of peaks, representing emissions from K and L lines normally appear. When a well calibrated spectrum is provided, the determination of the elements in the samples is relatively simple. However, accuracy is difficult to acheive when results from many samples are to be compared."
2,"Investigations regarding the feasibility, reliability, and accuracy of Fricke gel dosimeter layers for stereotactic radiosurgery are presented. A representative radiosurgery plan consisting of two targets has been investigated. Absorbed dose distributions measured using radiochromic films and gelatin Fricke Gel dosimetry in layers have been compared with dose distributions calculated by using a treatment planning system and Monte Carlo simulations. The different dose distributions have been compared by means of the gamma index demonstrating that gelatin Fricke gel dosimeter layers showed agreements of 100%, 100%, and 93%, with dose and distance tolerances of 2% and 2 mm, with respect to film dosimetry, treatment planning system and Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. The capability of the developed system for three-dimensional dose mapping was shown, obtaining promising results when compared …"
2,"Convergent beam radiotherapy, or CBRT, currently under development is based on the adaptation of a linear accelerator (linac) to a device which allows to dynamically curve the original trajectory of the electron beam so that it impacts upon a target. This produces a photon beam via Bremsstrahlung which converges on a predetermined focus point (isocenter). Adaptation of the RTHC device is only possible if it is sufficiently compact, as the device must be placed between the linac head exit and the gurney. This requires that new magnetic deflection devices be developed. This paper describes the theoretical and experimental development of controlled-deflection electron beam systems (at energies in MeV ranges) generated in a dual linear accelerator waveguide. A device which follows RTHC geometry is adapted for the system, using new magnetic deflector designs based on permanent neodymium magnets …"
2,"This work presents the characterization and contribution of neutron and gamma components to the absorbed dose in a zero power nuclear reactor. A dosimetric method based on Fricke gel was implemented to evaluate the separation between dose components in the mixed field. The validation of this proposed method was performed by means of direct measurements of neutron flux in different positions using Au and Mg-Ni activation foils. Monte Carlo simulations were conversely performed using the MCNP main code with a dedicated subroutine to incorporate the exact complete geometry of the nuclear reactor facility. Once nuclear fuel elements were defined, the simulations computed the different contributions to the absorbed dose in specific positions inside the core. Thermal/epithermal contributions of absorbed dose were assessed by means of Fricke gel dosimetry using different isotopic compositions aimed at …"
2,"Knowing the spectrum near the output of the relatively new mini X‐ray tube (MXRT) commercial models is fundamentally important in energy‐dispersive X‐ray fluorescence scan images, especially in the in vivo applications. This information is relevant for determining the absorbed dose during a measurement and for absolute quantification by a fundamental parameter method. However, it is not possible to measure it directly using a silicon drift detector (SDD) given the high saturation in the counts. In this work, an experimental methodology is developed for determining the kernel spectrum emitted by the MXRT, enabling the quantification of its energy flux density over short distances. Different distances were used: source–detector, solid emission angle (collimation), attenuation characteristics of the medium (air), and in a vacuum, within an energy range of 1–40 keV, to determine the X‐ray tube spectrum. The …"
2,Andic soils contain a large amount of stabilised soil organic matter (SOM). The present study aims to review and integrate the determining factors and mechanisms of SOM stabilisation in andic compared with other (non-andic) soil types. We have reviewed recent literature regarding the nature of SOM and its stabilisation processes in the top- and sub-soil to address and discuss the interaction between the SOM and the mineral phase. The carbon (C) storage capacity by the metal-humus-complex formation of volcanic soils is also evaluated. The most important stabilisation processes are related to the incorporation and decomposition of microbial-derived C along with the changing C storage capacity with increasing soil development. The priming and destabilisation of adsorbed SOM are crucial mechanisms influencing the soil C sequestration in subsoils. The C storage capacity of andic soils was closely related to …
2,"Enzyme activities (EAs) respond to contamination in several ways depending on the chemical form and content of heavy metals and metalloids (HMs) and their interactions with various soil properties. A systematic and mechanistic understanding of EA responses to HM contamination in soil is necessary for predicting the consequences for nutrient availability and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S). In this study, a meta-analysis based on 671 observations found the activities of seven enzymes to decrease in response to soil contamination with Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu and As. HM contamination linearly reduced the activities of all enzymes in the following order: arylsulfatase > dehydrogenase > β-glucosidase > urease > acid phosphatase > alkaline phosphatase > catalase. The activities of two endoenzymes: arylsulfatase (partly as exoenzyme) and dehydrogenase were reduced by 72% and …"
2,"Chilean volcanic soils are known to contain large amounts of organic matter (OM) and amorphous (e.g., allophanic) clay. Here, we test the hypothesis that Al, rather than clay content and climatic conditions, is the most important factor for OM levels in volcanic soils. This was achieved by compiling a total of 225 pedons from two national-wide datasets of south-Central Chilean soils sampled in the first 20 cm depth. All selected soils are of volcanic origin, previously under native Nothofagus-forest and now used as pasture or arable land. The relationships between soil organic C (from now soil C) and environmental and soil characteristics (clay-allophane, Al content) were analysed by simple and multiple linear regression analyses. Soils classify as Alfisols, Andisols, Inceptisols and Ultisols. Al was extracted by KCl (Alk), acid ammonium acetate (Ala) and acid ammonium oxalate (Alo). The simple regression models …"
2,"In previous studies, Al extracted by acid ammonium acetate (Ala) or Na-pyrophosphate (Alp), rather than silt or clay content and climate conditions, was the most important factor that controls organic matter (OM) levels in volcanic soils. Here, the hypothesis was tested that Ala is a comparable method (as much as CuCl2) to quantify the proportion of Al bound to OM in allophanic soils. As far as we know, there are no previous antecedents in which selective dissolution method has been compared with this extractant. Secondly, we examine the effects of (a) Al, (b) silt plus clay content (particles size 0–53 µm) and (c) clay mineralogy on the control of organic carbon (OC) level in Chilean volcanic soils. This was achieved by sampling 16 soils series (11 Andisols, one Alfisol and four Ultisols, USDA classification) including 48 soil pedons up to 0.4 m depth. Soils were analyzed for Ala, Alp, oxalate (Alo, Sio and Feo), cold …"
2," Nitrogen (N) mineralization in soil depends on carbon (C) input of plant materials, site environmental conditions, and soil texture. Empirical correlates of N mineralization can be difficult to interpret, however, because of interactions among these factors. A multiple regression model relating N mineralization to C input rates, litter quality, and soil texture in Chilean temperate rain forest soils was developed. Nitrogen mineralization rates ranged from 3.0 to 5.7 mg kg−1 soil d−1 depending on C input rate and soil texture but were not influenced by litter quality. We compared C storage of both forest and long‐term‐cropped soils with the protective capacity (i.e., the expected maximum C pool associated with the clay and silt fractions). Soil organic C associated with the fine fraction of forest soils was significantly greater than the calculated protective capacity, with clay‐rich soils averaging 141% more C than this limit and …"
2,"Every soil has a limited capacity to physical-chemically protect organic matter from biodegradation in its clay and silt particles. Thus, the rates at which carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are mineralized in soil should be related to the degree of C saturation in those particles. In this study the authors investigated the hypothesis that the decline in the amount of C in clay and silt particles from coarse to fine textured soil is due to a reduction of the specific surface area of clay and silt fractions in clay soils. The relation between the mineralization rates of C and N to the degree of C saturation in the clay and silt particles was also investigated. Six cultivated soils (cereal) and three non-cultivated soils (Medicago sativa L.) were sampled at 0-20 cm depth. All soils were ultrasonically treated and gravimetrically separated into fractions> 50 µm (sand) and< 50 µm (clay and silt). All fractions and whole soils were analyzed for organic-C and the specific surface area with ethylene glycol monoethyl (EGME). Moreover, there was a close relation between the degree of C saturation and the mineralization rates. However, there also was a good relation between the total organic C of the soil and the mineralization rates. This coincided with the fact that a good relation between the soil organic carbon and the degree of carbon saturation was found. Our results partially explain the hypothesis that the mineralization rates are more related to the degree of C saturation than to the soil texture (% clay and silt) and soil organic carbon."
2,"The effects of climate and topography on soil physico-chemical and microbial parameters were studied along an extensive latitudinal climate gradient in the Coastal Cordillera of Chile (26°–38°S). The study sites encompass arid (Pan de Azúcar), semiarid (Santa Gracia), mediterranean (La Campana) and humid (Nahuelbuta) climates and vegetation, ranging from arid desert, dominated by biological soil crusts (biocrusts), semiarid shrubland and mediterranean sclerophyllous forest, where biocrusts are present but do have a seasonal pattern to temperate-mixed forest, where biocrusts only occur as an early pioneering development stage after disturbance. All soils originate from granitic parent materials and show very strong differences in pedogenesis intensity and soil depth.Most of the investigated physical, chemical and microbiological soil properties showed distinct trends along the climate gradient.

2,"The Chilean Coastal Cordillera features a spectacular climate and vegetation gradient, ranging from arid and unvegetated areas in the north to humid and forested areas in the south. The EarthShape project (“Earth Surface Shaping by Biota”) uses this natural gradient to investigate how climate and biological processes shape the Earth's surface. We explored the Critical Zone, the Earth's uppermost layer, in four key sites located in desert, semidesert, Mediterranean, and temperate climate zones of the Coastal Cordillera, with the focus on weathering of granitic rock. Here, we present first results from 16 approximately 2 m-deep regolith profiles to document: (1) architecture of weathering zone; (2) degree and rate of rock weathering, thus the release of mineral-derived nutrients to the terrestrial ecosystems; (3) denudation rates; and (4) microbial abundances of bacteria and archaea in the saprolite.From north to south …"
2,"Soil biological activity has important implications for soil carbon (C) sequestration. However, very little is known about the environmental factors, particularly the effect of soil mineralogy on availability of C for soil microorganisms. In this study, we have investigated the influences of soil type (clay mineralogy) on C mineralization and its effects on biological activity at different levels of soil organic matter stability. Two soils an allophanic, derived from recent volcanic ash and a kaolinitic, resulting from metamorphic parent materials were physically fractioned in to light (LF, coarse sand 250-2000 µm), intermediate (IF, fine sand53-250 µm) and mineral (MF, silt and clay< 53 µm) fractions. Several biological and biochemical analyses at Ah horizons of mineral soil and physical fractions were conducted: soil respiration, enzymatic activities, carbohydratesand microbial biomass, amongst others soil variables. The results indicated that the bulk soiland physical fractions had a significant impact on cumulative C mineralizedafter 30 days of incubation and soil enzyme activities. More than 76% of total C-CO 2 variation was explained by stepwise multiple regression analysis including factors such as soil enzymes (ß-glucosidase, dehydrogenase and phosphatase) and inorganic P. Soil ATP extractionwas agood indicator of microbial activity, because of a positive and significant correlation among ATP and i) C-CO 2 and ii) metabolic quotient (soil respiration rate divided by microbial biomass). We also found an inverse and significant relationship between Al pyrophosphate (Al bound to SOM) and the C-CO 2 in volcanic soil, whereas the same correlation did not …"
2," A simple model was developed to estimate the contribution of nitrogen (N) mineralization to the N supply of crops. In this model the soil organic matter is divided into active and passive pools. Annual soil mineralization of N is derived from the active pool. The active pool comprises stabilized and labile soil organic N. The stabilized N is built up from accumulated inputs of fresh organic N during a crop rotation but the labile N is a fraction of total N added, which mineralizes faster than the stabilized N. The passive pool is considered to have no participation in the mineralization process. Mineralization rates of labile and stabilized soil organic N from different crop residues decomposing in soil were derived from the literature and were described by the first-order rate equation dN/dt =-K*N, where N is the mineralizable organic N from crop residues andK is a constant. The data were groupedK 1 by short-term (0–1 …"
2,"Microbial activity and functioning in soils are strongly limited by carbon (C) availability, of which a great proportion is released by living roots. Rhizodeposition and especially root exudates stimulate microbial activity and growth, and may shift the stoichiometric balance between C, N, and P. Thereby, exudates heighten microbial nutrient demand and acquisition of N and P from organic matter, leading to an increase in enzyme production. Aim of this study was to determine environmental controls of extracellular enzyme production, and hence on potential enzyme activities (Vmax) and substrate affinities (Km). To determine the controlling factors, we worked on four spatial scales from the microscale (i.e. rhizosphere) through the mesoscale (i.e. soil depth) and landscape scale (relief positions), and finally to the continental scale (1200 km transect within the Coastal Cordillera of Chile). Kinetics of seven hydrolyzing …"
2,"Rhizosphere, a thin area of soil surrounding roots receiving carbon (C) exudation from plants, represents a site of intense competition for available C and nutrient between surface-reactive particles and soil microorganisms. This competition can reduce the amount of available C to a critical level, it becomes limiting for microbial growth and soil organic matter decomposition. On the other hand, acceleration or retardation of decomposition of soil organic C caused by root activity is termed rhizosphere priming effect (RPE). This effect has been increasingly recognized to play a crucial role on native C destabilization as influenced by fresh C availability, microbial activity and soil mineralogy such as crystallinity of clay minerals and Al-, Fe-oxides. Combining microbial ecology and soil mineral interactions, we can understand how soil characteristics and climate change can influence below ground competition and finally RPE. In this review, we focus on the competition for available C in soil, limiting our analyses to the interaction at rhizospheric space, where most processes between microorganisms and mineral phase occurs."
2,"The existing information on soil carbon (C) stabilisation in allophanic soils is conflicting because active Al3+ and sesquioxides (i.e., the oxides/hydroxides of Al and Fe) as a stabilising agent of soil C are emphasised in opposition to allophane and imogolite type materials. Two hypotheses were tested in this study: 1) Al (and Fe) complexed with soil C and allophane content are the key variables to explain the soil C level in Chilean allophanic soils, and 2) the existing metal–SOM complex and short-range ordered aluminosilicate minerals in allophanic soils mainly result from soil pH variation and competition between Al (and Fe) for SOM and allophane formation. This study established the relationship among different soil properties such Al-, Fe-complexes and allophane content on soil C levels in Chilean volcanic soils as well as the effect of soil pH on metal–OM complexes. A total of 45 soil samples from 15 soil …"
2,"When studying carbon (C) sequestration in soil, it is necessary to recognize the maximal storage potential and the main influencing factors, including the climate, land use, and soil properties. Here, we hypothesized that the silt and clay contents in soils as well as the clay mineralogy are the main factors affecting the maximal C and N storage levels of soils. This hypothesis was evaluated using a database containing the organic C contents of topsoils separated by ultrasonic dispersion to determine the particle size fractions. The slopes of the linear regressions between the C contents in silt and clay to the soil organic C (SOC) and between the N contents in silt and clay to the total N content were independent of the clay mineralogy (2:1, 1:1, calcareous soil, amorphous clays), climate type (tropical, temperate, and Mediterranean), and land use type (cropland, grassland, and forest). This clearly shows that the silt and …"
2,"Biodiversity of phototrophic microorganisms in South American biological soil crusts (BSCs) and their role in the biogeochemical phosphorus (P)-cycle are unknown. Richness of BSC green algae and cyanobacteria was investigated at four climatically different Chilean sites (arid, semi-arid, Mediterranean, humid). Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and P contents, P pools and P speciation as well as spatial P species distribution within the BSCs were investigated. Morphological identification of enrichment cultures revealed 24 green algal and 18 cyanobacterial taxa in total. Irrespective of climatic conditions, each BSC comprised 12 to 15 different phototrophic species. Thereby, green algal richness increased, while cyanobacterial richness decreased with increasing humidity/decreasing mean annual temperature (North to South). Total C, N, and S contents ranged between 6.7 and 41.1 g C kg−1, 0.6–2.8 g N kg …"
2," Abstract Aim We sought to clarify the role of juvenile tree growth rates in species sorting along fine‐scale fertility gradients in the coast range forests of southern Chile. Location In montane forests in the coast range, the conifer Fitzroya cupressoides occupies the poorest soils, whereas dominance shifts to the evergreen angiosperms Nothofagus nitida and/or Weinmannia trichosperma on moderately infertile sites. On the most fertile sites, N. nitida is usually the sole overstorey dominant. Methods We examined the effects of soil depth and nitrogen availability on height growth and leaf nitrogen levels of the three common overstorey dominants. Sapling height growth rates and foliage nitrogen concentration were measured in 20 large gaps (>0.1 ha), on sites of varied soil depth and potential N‐mineralization rates. Results Height growth rates of Weinmannia and Nothofagus were strongly positively correlated with …"

2,"Now more than ever, public organizations are changing their role from developers to acquirers of software products and services. To accomplish the principles of transparency and economy that these organizations must preserve, they have adopted the building engineering practice of issuing call for tenders. In order to apply, prospective software suppliers need to analyze these documents, make the decision of participation and to confront the process of building a software offer. This process involves a set of software engineering practices that, up to now, have remained unexplored in terms of suppliers’ risks, mitigation strategies and decision variables. In this paper we present a qualitative research based on the focus group technique that provides some important clues to understand this process and define an initial set of variables to be further explored. Conclusions remark on the worth of field study and the next step on quantitative research using found variables."
2,"Context The electronic government has become a trend for transforming public management to comply with the performance of an efficient, modern state. The processes for public procurement and personnel recruitment represent an essential fraction of a country’s public spending. Objective Maturity models are tools for assessing different management dimensions resulting in some level of organizational maturity on an ordinal scale which can show null, partial, or total progress towards the desired state. This paper presents an e-government maturity model for public procurement and personnel recruitment processes, based on a literature review to determine the current state of research in the field. Methodology We have used a known procedural model from Becker to support the design of the proposed model. Later on, we have tested it with government buyers and personnel recruiters.

2,"Over the last two decades, governments have increased their investment in information technology to improve the use of public resources, using public electronic procurement systems to obtain better prices, better solutions and to show transparency in the procurement process. Public procurement of software development projects is specific acquisitions having specific technical, methodological, and management constraints that make transparency an elusive target. This article proposes a maturity model as a tool to measure tendering transparency when government agencies procure software development. We have used a procedural model to support the design of maturity models along four dimensions: Institutionalization, Software procurement process, Communication, and Accountability. We have defined a five-step model, and we have tested it with real government buyers. The model is supported by an …"
2,"A relevant part of software industry deals with ad hoc software solutions, which are externalized by software consumers. The process of acquirment follows a public procedure of requesting proposals. This procedure is based on a call-for-tenders document that contains, at least, a software specification and project constraints, such as budget and time. The general assumption is that the requirements stage happens prior to the call-for-tender process. However, public documents of software tendering processes support the contrary assumption. The aim of this paper is to sustain that call-for-tender processes require additional study from an empirical point of view in order to solve problems derived from current industry practices. We have analyzed call for tenders in relation to requirements engineering proposals and also under a procedural approach. In order to sustain the inclusion of call for tenders in the scope of software engineering a set of different open problems is identified."
2,"Outsourcing is a world wide trend that has also reached Software Industry, thus private and public organizations call for software providers to compete for a solution. The process begins with a public notice containing software requirements, economic and methodological conditions. Usually these calls are grouped into public and private Web sites that can accumulate a several calls which are difficult to analyze in a short time. In this paper we propose a set of metrics based on speech acts to reflect basic features of the call that could help providers from software industry to make a decision on those that best fit their profile in the market."
2,"Outsourcing of services has been an industry trend for more than two decades. In particular, public software acquisitions have followed this trend. Governments are significant consumers of software and these processes may fail due to different causes such as incomplete requirements elicitation, limited budget, lack of tenderers or even proper tenderers. Moreover, the fact of there being only one qualified tenderer may make the process suspect. The aim of this paper is to identify the variables which influence the result of a software tender process. We present a two-step research: first a quantitative approach and then a qualitative analysis. Initially we formulated the hypothesis that the quality of documents in public software tenders was related to the success of the bidding process. We studied 142 public tenders in Chile, which neither confirmed nor denied any relationship between success and quality of the tender document. In the second step, we applied a focus group and a semi-structured online questionnaire identifying N new potentially factors to success. For them, we found social theories supporting these relationships. The main contribution of this work is to propose a wider set of variables, not merely technical ones, which influence the success of software tender processes."
2,"The transparency of electronic procedures has become an important strategy to reduce corruption within state organizations and thus promote the sustainable and efficient management of fiscal resources, vital elements in the development of a country. E-government processes have become an important line of development, in which substantial investments have been made to have processes that allow for transparency in a large part of the country’s activities, specifically in the contracting and purchasing of public properties and services. The objective of the study is to present an overview of the work on initiatives that have been used around transparency and electronic procedures of electronic governments to identify which of these initiatives are associated with transparency and which effectively apply to electronic procedures for transparency to learn how these procedures allow for sustainable development of governments. The methodology used in this work was a systematic mapping of the literature, and the main findings suggest that this is a little-explored area."
2,"Under a broad comprehension of Software Engineering, it is preferred the term software life cycle instead of just software production. The reason is that cycle starts at software conception and stops when the software is relegated. Given contemporary companies’ market strategies of focusing on their competitive advantages, most of them have externalized their software production to outsourced services. Therefore, the call for software tenders has become a common step in the software life cycle. In this paper, we present a tool which aids non-experts to specify call for software tenders. The motivation was Chile situation of most of rural and semi-urban city halls which do not have engineering teams to build call for software tenders. We describe the problem in terms of lack of competitiveness and empty biddings generated by low quality calls for tenders. As a second step, we show the technical considerations to develop the proposed tool and its features. We include an initial tool perception from a first group of users."
2,"As cyber-attacks grow worldwide, companies have begun to realize the importance of being protected against malicious actions that seek to violate their systems and access their information assets. Faced with this scenario, organizations must carry out correct and efficient management of their information security, which implies that they must adopt a proactive attitude, implementing standards that allow them to reduce the risk of computer attacks. Unfortunately, the problem is not only implementing a standard but also determining the best way to do it, defining an implementation path that considers the particular objectives and conditions of the organization and its availability of resources. This paper proposes a methodological approach for selecting and planning security controls, standardizing and systematizing the process by modeling the situation (objectives and constraints), and applying optimization techniques. The work presents an evaluation of the proposal through a methodology adoption study. This study showed a tendency of the study subjects to adopt the proposal, perceiving it as a helpful element that adapts to their way of working. The main weakness of the proposal was centered on ease of use since the modeling and resolution of the problem require advanced knowledge of optimization techniques."
2," Nowadays, governments and private sectors request industry software solutions through public tenders that use websites for mass distribution. Not only is demand organized, but a large number of software tenders is produced. This study focuses on the analysis of texts from these documents to characterize them efficiently in order to find a specific solution to the general problem of how to make a bid and how not to make a bid. An automatic classifier is proposed for the public tender process for software based on IEEE standard 830-1998, which categorizes text from a pragmatic point of view. Development phases and classification success rates are shown for each algorithm used in the different experiments. This system may be an alternative for the early analysis of public tenders for software with fuzzy requirements."

Given the Science and Technology initiatives, these topics are considered in different training cycles: primary, secondary and higher education. In the case of higher education, students must cultivate fundamental concepts for developing computer applications, which contribute to not only the knowledge of programming languages but also open guidelines for computational thinking. In previous research, we evaluated a set of platforms under a usability lens; on this occasion, we compare these results and their impact on the learning outcomes. We evaluated three experimental groups that used video game platforms to achieve their learning outcomes. Additionally, we will synthesize the literature regarding new paradigms of programming education under immersive environments."

Data mining is an intrinsically complex process that expert users generally use. The non-expert users are overwhelmed because they lack relevant techniques for analyzing and understanding these results. This proposal presents a usability experiment to evaluate the level of understanding of the results when applying classification techniques. The users worked with decision trees, one of the “friendliest” of existing patterns. We need to start focusing on new patterns for non-expert users from the results exposed."

2,"It is possible to incorporate a lot of natural antioxidants into the human organism by consuming berries which can prevent diseases generated by the action of free radicals. Antioxidants neutralize free radicals and thus protect the organism from the oxidative damage of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Berries stand out as one of the richest sources of antioxidant phytonutrients among various fruits and vegetables. The objective of this research was to determine antioxidant capacity (AC), total anthocyanins (TA), and total phenols (TP) of wild and cultivated berries in different localities of La Araucanía and Los Ríos Regions in Chile. These parameters were analyzed by using the free radical 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) method, pH-differential, and Folin-Ciocalteu method. Percentages of DPPH discoloration of different berries studied were between 67.8% and 95.3% for red sarsaparilla and rosehip, respectively. Maqui berries showed a significantly higher TA content (2240.2 and 1445.3 mg L-1 cyanidin 3-glucoside) than other berries, and a mean for all berries of 335.5 mg L-1. Higher phenol content levels were obtained in two cultivars of saskatoon (773.9 and 1001.9 mg L-1 gallic acid) and wild rosehip (1457.0 and 1140.4 mg L-1 gallic acid). We conclude that there are significant differences in antioxidant capacity of wild and cultivated Chilean berries in this study which show a strong correlation between AC and TP content."
2," Abstract In this work, the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by Galega officinalis extract using AgNO3 as a precursor was reported. The reaction parameters for the biosynthesis and efficiency in their antimicrobial control against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas syringae were determined. For biosynthesis, a central composite design combined with response surface methodology was used to optimize the process parameters (pH, AgNO3 and extract concentration), and the design was assessed through the size distribution, zeta potential and polydispersity index of the nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that at pH 11, 1.6 mM of AgNO3 and 15% vv−1 of G. officinalis extract were the optimal reaction parameters.

Fungi have received recognition for interesting metabolic activities that have an enormous variety of biotechnological applications. Previously, volatile organic compounds produced by fungi (FVOCs) have been demonstrated to have a great capacity for use as antagonist products against plant pathogens. However, in recent years, FVOCs have been received attention as potential alternatives to the use of traditional pesticides and, therefore, as important eco-friendly biotechnological tools to control plant pathogens. Therefore, highlighting the current state of knowledge of these fascinating FVOCs, the actual detection techniques and the bioactivity against plant pathogens is essential to the discovery of new products that can be used as biopesticides."

2,"In this study, we selected and characterized different pesticide-tolerant bacteria isolated from a biomixture of a biopurification system that had received continuous applications of a pesticides mixture. The amplicon analysis of biomixture reported that the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were predominant. Six strains grew in the presence of chlorpyrifos and iprodione. Biochemical characterization showed that all isolates were positive for esterase, acid phosphatase, among others, and they were identified as Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Achromobacter based on molecular and proteomic analysis. Bacterial growth decreased as both pesticide concentrations increased from 10 to 100 mg L-1 in liquid culture. The Achromobacter sp. strain C1 showed the best chlorpyrifos removal rate of 0.072–0.147 d-1 a half-life of 4.7–9.7 d and a maximum metabolite concentration of 2.10 mg L-1 at 120 h. On the other hand, Pseudomonas sp. strain C9 showed the highest iprodione removal rate of 0.100–0.193 d-1 a half-life of 4–7 d and maximum metabolite concentration of 0.95 mg L-1 at 48 h. The Achromobacter and Pseudomonas strains showed a good potential as chlorpyrifos and iprodione-degrading bacteria."
2,"Chlorpyrifos (CP) is an organophosphorus pesticide (OP) widely used in agriculture. Evidence of CP residues in soil, water and food has generated an urgent need to develop treatment systems that avoid possible damage to human health and the environment. In this study, eight diazinon-degrading Streptomyces strains were evaluated for their ability to remove CP as the only carbon source from a liquid medium. Single cultures removed 32–74% of CP, and most of the strains incremented their biomass. Additionally, changes in the protein profile were found. Protein extract analyses demonstrated that four organisms exhibited the enzyme organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH); therefore, the Streptomyces spp. AC5, AC9, GA11 and ISP13 strains were used as a mixed culture to study the removal of CP and their main metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP).

2," Lignin is one of the main barriers to obtaining added-value products from cellulosic fraction of lignocellulosic biomass due to its random aromatic structure and strong association with cellulose and hemicellulose. Inorganic and organic compounds have been used as enzyme inducers to increase the ligninolytic potential of white-rot fungi, without considering their effect on the selectivity of degradation. In this study, the selective lignin degradation in wheat straw by Ganoderma lobatum was optimized using a central composite design to evaluate the combined effect of Fe2+ and Mn2+ as inducers of ligninolytic enzymes and NO3 − as an additional nitrogen source. Selective lignin degradation was promoted to maximize lignin degradation and minimize weight losses. The optimal conditions were 0.18 M NO3 −, 0.73 mM Fe2+, and 1 mM Mn2+, which resulted in 50.0% lignin …"
2,"Actinobacteria identified as Streptomyces spp. were evaluated for their ability to remove diazinon as the only carbon source from a liquid medium. Single cultures of Streptomyces strains were exposed to diazinon at a concentration of 50 mg L−1. After 96 h incubation, six of the eight cultures grew and five strains showed an increase in their total protein concentrations and changes in their protein profile. Up to 32% of the diazinon was removed by the single Streptomyces cultures. A compatibility assay showed that the different Streptomyces species were not antagonistic. Twenty-six mixed cultures were then prepared. Diazinon removal was increased when mixed cultures were used, and maximum diazinon removal of 62% was observed when the Streptomyces spp. strains AC5, AC9, GA11 and ISP13 were mixed; this was defined as the selected mixed culture (SMC). Diazinon removal was positively influenced by …"
2,"Interactions between microorganisms and root exudates in a biobed system with vegetal (grass) cover could enhance pesticide degradation. Otherwise, a high water load may generate high concentrations of pesticides in lixiviates. We studied the effect of the vegetal cover on the degradation of a mixture of atrazine (ATZ), chlorpyrifos (CHL) and iprodione (IPR)(35 mg L-1 each) in a biobed system operated with two different hydraulic loads (0.6 and 1.2 L of tap water per day). The concentration of the pesticides and their main metabolites were measured in the lixiviates during 60 days, as well as in the biomixtures at the end of the study. Dehydrogenase activity in the biomixtures and organic acid exudation from the vegetal cover were also analysed. The vegetal cover diminished the lixiviation of pesticides and their metabolites mainly at the lower hydraulic load used. The degradation of the pesticides was high (> 95%) and increased in biobeds with vegetal cover and low hydraulic load. Degradation metabolites of CHL and IPR were formed during pesticide degradation; however they were degraded in the biobed and were not detected in lixiviates at the end of the study. In general, an increase in organic acid exudation by vegetal cover was observed caused by chemical stress after pesticide application. The increase was similar at both hydraulic loads. Efficient colonisation of wheat straw by fungi was observed by confocal microscopy."
2,"Acid mine drainage, characterized by low pH and elevated heavy metal ion concentrations, causes severe harm to the environment. In this study, the feasibility of a new organic biomixture adsorbent for removing Fe 3+, Zn 2+, Cu 2+ and Mn 2+ metal ions from synthetic acid mine drainage was evaluated. This kinetic study showed fast metal ions adsorption within the first four to eight hours, and adsorption over 80% in the organic biomixture. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms resulted in a metal ion uptake greater than 84%, and the Freundlich model fitted well the data. The Freundlich affinity coefficient (K f) ranged from 1.44 to 3.82 in the following order: Zn 2+> Cu 2+> Fe 3+> Mn 2+. Scanning electron microscope images revealed the heterogeneous structure of the biomixture, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis after adsorption confirmed the ability of the biomixture to remove the metal ions. In the fixed-bed …"
2,"Biosurfactants, a wide group of compounds produced by different microorganisms, generally have less toxicity and are more biodegradable than synthetic surfactants. Biosurfactant-producing bacteria can be found in contaminated environments, such as soils receiving pesticide applications constantly, or in pesticides treatment systems where microorganisms are adapted to biodegrading pesticides. Five pesticide-tolerant bacteria previously isolated from a pesticide biopurification system were evaluated as biosurfactant-producers. Pseudomonas rhodesiae C4, Rhodococcus jialingiae C8 and Pseudomonas marginalis C9 strains were positive in qualitative tests. Biosurfactant production by these strains using Bushnell-Haas medium with olive oil at 2% (w/v) was evaluated as emulsification index, oil displacement, droplet collapse test and surface tension. After 144 h, these strains showed a similar emulsification index of >55%. The two Pseudomonas (C4 and C9) strains showed lower superficial tension compared with Rhodococcus strain (C8)—34.47, 37.44 and 47.55 mN/m for strains C4, C9 and C8, respectively. The chemical characterization of the biosurfactants revealed the presence of glycolipids in P. rhodesiae (C4) and glycopeptides in P. marginalis (C9). The degradation of chlorpyrifos increased from 39.2% to 51.6% when biosurfactants produced by P. rhodesiae (C4) were added (10%) with respect to the control. Therefore, biopurification systems are a relevant source of biosurfactant-producing bacteria with environmental biotechnology applications."
2,"Fungal volatile secondary metabolites play important roles in mediating antagonistic and beneficial interactions among organisms. The effects of eight strains of white-rot fungi cultured on potato waste against the mycelial growth of Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum and Mucor miehei were investigated using a bi-compartmented Petri dish assay. The chemical composition of volatile organic compounds released from the strain with the highest inhibitory effect was also investigated by headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Of the eight white-rot fungi evaluated, Anthracophyllum discolor. Sp4 showed a high inhibitory activity against M. miehei (approximately 76%) and B. cinerea (approximately 20%). F. oxysporum was inhibited to a lesser extent (approximately 10%) by A. discolor and T. versiscolor. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis …"
2,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is known for its ability to produce and release al-lelopathic compounds, which have potential for controlling weeds and diseases. Previous reports have shown the fungitoxic effects of allelochemicals present in wheat. Thus, these compounds can be exuded by roots to protect the tissues directly affected by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt) fungus that causes wheat take-all disease. The aim of this research was to evaluate in vitro the allelopathic effect of root exudate extracts from four Chilean wheat cultivars on Ggt growth. Root exudates were released from wheat seedlings to a sterile culture medium without nutrients. Afterward, the exudates in the culture medium were separated by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate. Eight different concentrations were tested for each cultivar. The results showed that the degree to which the extracts strongly inhibit the phytopathogen growth is highly dependent on both the concentration and the cultivar. The root extract of the Domo cultivar was significantly active against Ggt (MIC= 0.36 mg mL-1). IC 50 and MIC values obtained for Dollinco and Domo root exudate extracts showed toxicity to Ggt. These findings may be considered in future studies related to the use of allelopathic potential as a selection factor in order to reduce the yield losses caused by various take-all diseases, as an alternative to chemical controls."
2,"This study provides the basis for implementing a continuous treatment system for wastewater containing a pesticide mixture formed by atrazine, iprodione, and chlorpyrifos. Two fungal strains (Verticilium sp. H5 and Metacordyceps sp. H12) isolated from a biomixture of a biopurification system were able to remove different pesticide concentrations (10 to 50 mg L−1) efficiently from the liquid medium; however, the half-life of the pesticides was reduced and characterized by a T1/2 of 5.4 to 9.2 d for atrazine, 3.7 to 5.8 d for iprodione, and 2.6 to 2.9 d for chlorpyrifos using the fungal consortium. The immobilization of the fungal consortium in alginate bead was effective, with the highest pesticide removal observed using an inoculum concentration of 30% wv−1. The packed-bed reactor with the immobilized fungal consortium, which was operated in the continuous mode at different flow rates (30, 60, and 90 mL h−1), required approximately 10 d to achieve removal efficiency (atrazine: 59%; iprodione: 96%; chlorpyrifos: ~85%). The bioreactor was sensitive to flow rate fluctuations but was able to recover performance quickly. The pesticide metabolites hydroxyatrazine, 3,5-dichloroaniline, and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol were produced, and a slight accumulation of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol was observed. Nevertheless, reactor removal efficiency was maintained until the study ended (60 d)."
2,"Potato waste was processed and used as a sole substrate for simultaneously producing antifungals and biopigments using Streptomyces spp. Out of three different Streptomyces isolates, strain SO6 stood out due to its ability to produce antifungals against economically important fungal phytopathogens and intracellular biopigments using potato waste powders without additional nutrients. This strain also showed the potential to secrete a broad range of enzymes for fermentation of eight sugars that could be involved in potato waste bioconversion. The results of the fermentation assay indicated that Streptomyces sp. strain SO6 degrades potato wastes during submerged fermentation, diminishing total dry weight and increasing reducing sugars from 0.3 to 3.6 mg·mL−1 and total proteins from 70.6 to 187.7 μg·mL−1. The results showed that Streptomyces strain SO6 was able to convert the potato waste into 0.96 mg·g−1 of diffusible antifungals and 1.75 mg·g−1 of reddish-purple biopigments. On the contrary, an absence of pigment production was observed during the fermentation of the commercial medium used as reference. According to our results, replacement of commercial culture media with available low-cost agroindustrial wastes for producing bioactive chemicals is a real opportunity to enhance the Streptomyces pigment production and antibiotic sustainability with cost-competitiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the simultaneous production of biopigments and diffusible antifungal antibiotics produced by Streptomyces spp. using potato solid waste as the sole nutrient source."

In the present study the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of its fruits were studied and also compared with data obtained for other berry fruits from southern Chile including maqui (Aristotelia chilensis) and murtilla (Ugni molinae). Polyphenolic compounds in calafate fruit were essentially present in glycosylated form, 3-glucoside conjugates being the most abundant anthocyanins. The anthocyanin content in calafate berries (17.81 ± 0.98 μmol g−1) and flavonol level (0.16 ± 0.01 μmol g−1) are comparable with those found in maqui (17.88 ± 1.15 and 0.12 ± 0.01 μmol g−1, respectively); however, maqui shows lower flavan-3-ol concentration than calafate (0.11 ± 0.01 and 0.24 ± 0.03 μmol g−1, respectively).

3,"Chilean Patagonia is one of the most beautiful natural scenarios, with a great diversity of habitats and vascular plants, including different berry fruits. There is no scientific information about the polyphenol profiles of most of these fruits, as well as about their potential use as functional food. Samples of 10 different berry species were collected in the Magallanes region in the extreme South of Chile. Their anthocyanin profiles were studied using liquid chromatography with photodiode array and mass spectrometry detection on the basis of retention times, UV and MS/MS spectra. In addition, total anthocyanin concentrations obtained by HPLC-DAD, antioxidant capacity estimated by TEAC (as trolox equivalent), and ascorbic acid contents were determined in these fruits.

3,"Calafate (Berberis microphylla G. Forst) is a Patagonian barberry very rich in anthocyanins and one of the fruits with the highest levels of these polyphenols. Other phenolic compounds have also been described in calafate berries. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no available information on hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The complexity of hydroxycinnamic acids determination in calafate berries, due to their structure similarities and the interference of high anthocyanin concentration is addressed by means of solid liquid extraction, followed by solid phase extraction clean-up on MCX columns and HPLC-DAD–ESI-MS/MS. The optimized extraction, clean-up and HPLC separation method allowed the assignation of identity and quantification of 20 hydroxycinnamic acids from calafate fruits. 5-Caffeoylquinic acid was the main compound found in all the studied samples.

3,"In this work, the anti-Helicobacter pylori effect of an aqueous extract from dried leaves of Peumus boldus Mol. (Monimiaceae) was evaluated. This extract displayed high inhibitory activity against H. pylori urease. Therefore, in order to clarify the type of substances responsible for such effect, a bioassay‐guided fractionation strategy was carried out. The active compounds in the fractions were characterized through different chromatographic methods (RP‐HPLC; HILIC‐HPLC). The fraction named F5 (mDP = 7.8) from aqueous extract was the most active against H. pylori urease with an IC50 = 15.9 µg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/mL. HPLC analysis evidenced that F5 was composed mainly by catechin‐derived proanthocyanidins (LC‐MS and phloroglucinolysis). The anti‐adherent effect of boldo was assessed by co‐culture of H. pylori and AGS cells. Both the aqueous extract and F5 showed an anti‐adherent …"
3,"Diverse edible berries are native to the Patagonian region of Southern Chile. These berries are underused because their nutritional properties are relatively unknown. In this work, the profiles and concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavonols, and the antioxidant capacity of the berry extracts, were studied using HPLC–DAD–ESI–MS/MS and CUPRAC assays, respectively. In total, 46 compounds were identified, including 17 hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and 26 flavonols. Caffeoylquinic acid isomers were the most abundant compounds, and quercetin and myricetin derivatives were the main flavonols found. The berries from Ribes genera showed a high diversity and concentration of these 2 families of compounds and contained 3-caffeoylquinic acid and quercetin-3-rutinoside at the highest concentrations. The Patagonian berries, especially the berries of Rubus and Ribes genera, had high …"
3," Background The main methods used to increase the yield and quality of strawberry fruit produced in acidic soils with low P availability include root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and adjusting the type of P supplementation by means of traditional (TF) or organic (OF) fertilization, and adjusting nutrient doses. In this study, the antioxidant properties of strawberry fruit were evaluated under different treatments of fertilization (TF or OF) and different doses of P supplied at planting (0, 50 or 100% of the agronomic recommendation) and in the presence or absence of AM fungus as a bioinoculant. Results Fruits without fertilization treatments and with TF presented with higher anthocyanin concentrations. In general, higher values were obtained without AM colonization. However, spectrophotometric tests showed the highest activity and concentration in the AM‐inoculated treatments. It is likely that …"
3,"There are 20 species of the Berberidaceae family described in Chile, whose fruits are edible and show high anthocyanin and hydroxycinnamic acid levels. Berberis microphylla G. Forst, commonly known as calafate, is the most extensively distributed. Flavonols and alkaloids in seed, pulp, skin, and whole calafate berry extracts and other Berberis were studied using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS and HPLC with fluorescence detector. Berry samples from different locations in Chilean Patagonia, including different phenological stages, were systematically addressed. Results were compared with other organs of the plant and with other Berberis species. Total flavonol concentration in calafate (n = 65) was 1.33 ± 0.54 μmol/g. Glycosyl metabolites of quercetin and isorhamnetin were the most abundant. Similar profiles were observed in calafate from distinct locations, but important differences were observed for the other edible …"
3,"Calafate (Berberis microphylla G. Forst) is an edible wild berry growing in South Patagonia that is very rich in anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Calafate contains unusual phenolic compounds compared to other berries, such as anthocyanidin dihexosides, different from the common 3,5-diglucosides, and isomeric esters of caffeic acid with hexaric acids. After isolation, their structures have been elucidated by UV–vis, MS/MS, and NMR spectroscopies. The anthocyanidin dihexosides constitute the complete series of 3,7-β-O-diglucosides of the five anthocyanidins usually found in calafate, the structures of which were completely elucidated in the cases of delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin derivatives and tentatively suggested in the cases of cyanidin and peonidin, and their occurrence seems to be characteristic of calafate among other wild berries from South Patagonia.

3,"This work examined the capability of Imperata cylindrica to respond, tolerate and accumulate Cu when growing at high Cu concentration (300 mg kg−1 of substrate) at different times of exposure (2, 14 and 21 days). The Cu accumulation in plants was examined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and Cu localized by Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy. Additionally, the phenolic compound identifications and concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Our results showed that root biomass decreased significantly at high Cu levels, with a greater decrease at 21 days (39.8% less biomass in comparison to control). The root showed 328 mg Cu kg−1 dry weight at 21 days of exposure to Cu, being the tissue that accumulates most of the Cu. Lipid peroxidation was a clear indicator of Cu stress, principally in shoots. The exposure to Cu significantly increased the synthesis of phenolic compounds in shoots of plants exposed 21 days to Cu, where 5-caffeoylquinic acid reached the highest concentrations. Our results support that I. cylindrica is a Cu accumulator plant in root organs with a medium level of accumulation (between 200–600 mg Cu kg−1 biomass), which can tolerate the exposure to high Cu levels by means of increasing the synthesis of phenolic compound in shoots, suggesting a potential use as phytoremediation tool in Cu polluted environments."
3,"Phenolic composition of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) with colored flesh has been previously reported, highlighting their anthocyanin composition. However, there is less information available about the profiles and concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (HCADs) in these potatoes. In pigmented potatoes from Southern Chile, three HCADs have been detected, corresponding to the trans isomers of 3-, 4- and 5-caffeoylquinic acid. It is remarkable that after frying, the HCAD concentrations increased 493% compared to those of fresh potatoes. The same tendency has been observed for total phenols and antioxidant activity of the chips. The results obtained are relevant in relation to the classification of pigmented potatoes as functional foods not only due to their anthocyanin content but also due to their higher content of HCADs, especially since their concentration increases considerably after frying, thus …"
3,"In this study, finger millet straw (FMS) was utilized for the production of Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) by Bacillus megaterium strain CAM12. Ultrasound-assisted alkaline (NaOH) pretreatment of FMS under optimized conditions followed by enzymatic saccharification resulted in the maximum delignification (72%), hydrolysis yield (84%), glucose yield (86%) and xylose yield (61%). The effects of different pH, temperature, incubation period, inoculum concentration, agitation speed and FMS enzymatic hydrolysates concentration were investigated to improve the PHB production. Under optimized conditions, strain CAM12 used the FMS hydrolysates as the sole carbon source for their growth and produced 8.31 g L−1 of PHB. The extracted polymer on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses were confirmed to be PHB. These results suggest the potential of …"
3,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin commonly present in wine and other foods. It is a secondary metabolite produced by several fungi species of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. OTA is nephrotoxic and was classified by the IARC in 1993 as possible carcinogen for human. The European Commission and OIV have fixed limits of this mycotoxin in wine and other foods. OIV set the maximum concentration of OTA in wine in 2.0 μg L−1 and recommends that wine producing countries should set up an analysis system to survey OTA contamination risk starting from the vineyard to the wine cellar. On these grounds, this study has for main objective to establish a wide diagnostic of the incidence of OTA in wines produced in Chile, covering a distance of 1000 km between the Elqui valley in the North and the Bio–Bio valley in the South, with different climates and growing conditions.

3," Background Strawberries are consumed worldwide. In Chile, strawberry production has been established in Andisols, were phosphorus is scarce. Traditional fertilization (TF) and organic fertilization (OF) have both been established there. This study examined their impact on the polyphenolic content of strawberries. Results Two anthocyanins were identified by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC‐DAD‐ESI‐MS/MS). The average total anthocyanin concentrations were found to be 651 mg kg−1 fresh weight in 100% OF, which represents a 56% increase compared to fruits that were not fertilized. In the case of flavonols, only quercetin‐rhamnoside was identified, and its concentration reached 14.6 mg kg−1 with 100% OF. The ascorbic acid concentration reached 0.54 g kg−1 in 50% TF (a 20% increase over fruits without fertilization, WF). The …"
3,"The Copihue (Lapageria rosea), also known as the Chilean bellflower, is the national flower of Chile and is the only species in the genus Lapageria. The copihue's tepals are commonly red, with white or pink being less common. The red color of the copihue has been glorified in legends, poems and popular songs. The present work studies the pigments that confer red copihues their characteristic color. The principal types of cyanidin present in red copihue's tepals are cyanidin-3-O-rhamnosylglucoside, followed by cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and while only the latter is detected in pink tepals and neither one are detected in white flowers."
3,"Potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers stand out for their natural pigmentation granted by anthocyanins. There is currently little information about their stability in terms of concentration, antioxidant activity and colouration to certain storage factors; therefore, we aimed to analyse such variables during storage for four months under different pH and temperature conditions and in the presence or absence of light. In general, the most deleterious condition for maintaining total anthocyanins was under light at room temperature, which presented a decrease of ~85%. In contrast, in liquid extracts the optimal storage conditions were 4 °C in the dark, with a loss of ~4%. The antioxidant activity and colour analyses showed optimal stability in the liquid extracts. This would make it possible to deliver added value to purple fleshed potato extracts because they are a good source of natural antioxidant pigments with potential …"
3," Diuron is one of the major hazardous pollutants which posses severe risk to the environment and human healthiness. On the other hand, salinity is the most severe environmental stressor that limits crop productivity. Therefore, it is required to address this co-existing abiotic stresses in agricultural soil. Plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria have gained an engaging role in the degradation of pesticides in agricultural soil. However, their role against the restoration of diuron-contaminated saline soil is still not known. Thus, in this study, diuron-degrading, salinity-tolerant Stenotrophomonas rhizophila strain CASB3 was isolated and characterized. Strain CASB3 showed important PGP traits under normal and diuron or salt stresses. Complete degradation of 10–50 mg L−1 diuron in the aqueous medium under normal and salinity stress conditions was achieved within 48–120 h and 48–192 h, respectively. A unique …"
3,"Silicon (Si) exerts beneficial effects in mitigating aluminum (Al) toxicity in different plant species. These include attenuating oxidative damage and improving structural strengthening as a result of the increased production of secondary metabolites such as phenols. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of Si on phenol production and composition in two barley cultivars under Al stress. Our conceptual approach included a hydroponic experiment with an Al-tolerant (Sebastian) and an Al-sensitive (Scarlett) barley cultivar treated with two Al doses (0 or 0.2 mM of Al) and two Si doses (0 or 2 mM) for 21 days. Chemical, biochemical and growth parameters were assayed after harvest. Our results indicated that the Al and Si concentration decreased in both cultivars when Al and Si were added in combination. Silicon increased the antioxidant activity and soluble phenol concentration, but reduced lipid peroxidation irrespective of the Al dose. Both barley cultivars showed changes in culm creep rate, flavonoids and flavones concentration, lignin accumulation and altered lignin composition in Si and Al treatments. We concluded that Si fertilization could increase the resistance of barley to Al toxicity by regulating the metabolism of phenolic compounds with antioxidant and structural functions."
3,"Maqui (Aristotelia chilensis) is an edible berry native to Southern Chile. The anthocyanin profiles and concentrations of this fruit have been widely studied. The high concentration of anthocyanins confers a deep colour to the skin and pulp of maqui berries, and the biological activity of this fruit has been attributed to these compounds. However, other compounds such as flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives in this fruit have not been studied to date."
3," Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) present a long duration and a slow progression. Good nutrition plays a predominant role in NCD prevention. In Chile, the cultivation of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) has recently been adapted to volcanic soils with low available phosphorus (P), which can affect the fruit quality in terms of their antioxidant compound content and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we carried out a study using organic (OF) or chemical (TF) fertilisers at 50 and 100% of the agronomical dose recommendation and without fertilisation (WF) under field conditions. Identification of phenolic compounds was done by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS, whereas antioxidant activities were determined by spectrophotometric methods.

3,"Three cationic bis-cyclometallated iridium complexes [Ir(C^N-ppyMe)2(P^N)][PF6](1-3) with 4-methyl-2-phenylpyridine (ppyMe) as the C^N-cyclometallated ligands and 8-(diphenylphosphino)quinoline (Ph2Pqn, L1), 2-(diphenylphosphinoamino)pyridine (Ph2PNHpy, L2) or 2-(diphenylphosphinoamino) pyrimidine (Ph2PNHpym, L3) as P^N-ligands, were prepared, and their crystal structures and photoluminescence were investigated. The substitution of an “aromatic CAr” (of a quinolyl group) by an “NH” bridge between the phosphine and imine ligating units of the P^N ligand dramatically changes the luminescence characteristics of the resulting complexes. The complexes 2–3 featuring the P–NH–N ligand emit in the blue region, whereas complex 1 incorporating the P–CAr–N unit displays orange photoluminescence."
3," Two ruthenium (II) complexes containing heterobidentated phosphorou-nitrogen ligands were studied as homogeneous catalysts in the hydrogenation of furfural, a key step in the transformation of biomass to biofuels or renewable chemicals. The catalysts exhibited high percentages of conversion towards the formation of furfuryl alcohol. The studied ruthenium (II) complexes are able to maintain their catalytic activities in substrate/catalyst ratios ranging from 1000/1 to 6000/1. The reaction is sensitive to hydrogen pressure and the substrate concentration. The maximum conversion is achieved at a pressure of 40 bar and a substrate/catalyst ratio of 3000/1 (TOF 3000 h−1). In situ 1H‐NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) analysis suggests that the presence of a phosphorous–nitrogen ligand improves the catalytic activity of the complex by stabilizing the intermediate ruthenium‐dihydride, which is considered …"
3,"In this paper, we report the catalytic activity of a series of ruthenium (II) complexes containing phosphorus-nitrogen bidentated (P-N) ligands in the hydrogenation of furfural via hydrogen transfer reaction using two hydrogen donor sources: 2-propanol in basic medium and formic acid under mild conditions. The results showed that all the ruthenium complexes studied are catalytically active in the hydrogenation of furfural by hydrogen transfer reaction; they showed 100% conversion with both hydrogen sources. However, selectivities towards the formation of furfuryl alcohol were better when formic acid was used. It was also found that the reaction studied in a basic medium competes with the Cannizzaro reaction, obtaining furfuryl alcohol and furoic acid in a 70/30 ratio; on the other hand, using formic acid as the hydrogen source yields furfuryl alcohol with 100% selectivity. Although formic acid can be used as a …"
3,"A series of a new type of tetracyclic carbazolequinones incorporating a carbonyl group at the ortho position relative to the quinone moiety was synthesized and analyzed by tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS-MS), using Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) to dissociate the protonated species. Theoretical parameters such as molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), local Fukui functions and local Parr function for electrophilic attack as well as proton affinity (PA) and gas phase basicity (GB), were used to explain the preferred protonation sites. Transition states of some main fragmentation routes were obtained and the energies calculated at density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP level were compared with the obtained by ab initio quadratic configuration interaction with single and double excitation (QCISD). The results are in accordance with the observed distribution of ions. The nature of the substituents in the aromatic ring has a notable impact on the fragmentation routes of the molecules."
3,"Aminocarbonylation of aryl halides, homogeneously catalysed by palladium, is an efficient method that can be employed for obtaining amides for pharmaceutical and synthetic applications. In this work, palladium (II) complexes containing P^N ligands were studied as catalysts in the aminocarbonylation of iodobenzene in the presence of diethylamine. Two types of systems were used: a palladium (II) complex formed in situ; and one prepared prior to the catalytic reaction. In general, the palladium complexes studied achieved high conversions in an average reaction time of less than 2 hr, which is less than that for the standard system (Pd (II)/PPh3) used. The pre‐synthesized complexes were faster than their in situ counterparts, as the latter require an induction time to form the Pd/P^N species. The structure and electronic properties of the ligand P^N can influence both the activity and the selectivity of the reaction …"

Single crystal diffraction analysis for all synthesized ruthenium complexes shows non-regular octahedral coordination around the metal. All the synthesized Ru(II) complexes achieved high conversions and turnover frequencies in hydrogen transfer reaction to acetophenone (830 h−1) and imine hydrogenation (760 h−1 for N-benzylideneaniline).

A series of new nickel (II) complexes bearing phosphorous-nitrogen (P,N) or phosphorous-nitrogen-phosphorous (P,N,P) ligands were characterized and studied as catalysts in hydrogen transfer reaction of imines, using formic acid as a hydrogen source, while avoiding the use of molecular hydrogen (H2). The complexes, of general formula NiCl2(L), [Ni(L)2](CF3SO3)2 (in which L is a P,N ligand) and [NiCl(L)]Cl (in the case of a tridentate PNP ligand), were active catalysts in the imine hydrogen, with turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 373 h−1 with NiCl2L1 complex (L1 = 2-(diphenylphosphinoamino) pyridine) and N-benzylideneaniline as substrate, while a [Ni(L)2](CF3SO3)2 complex bearing the same P,N ligand achieved a slightly lower activity (TOF = 320 h−1 …"
3,"The arylhalide aminocarbonylation reaction is important because several pharmaceutical and industrial products can be obtained through a catalytic process. For example, some steroidal skeleton can be functionalized by adding a carboxamide moiety, which improves or creates enzyme inhibitory properties [1]. Catalyzed by palladium complexes, aminocarbonylation seems to be an interesting way to get these products [2]. Complexes of Palladium (II) containing nitrogen-phosphorus ligands have been studied in the styrene alkoxycarbonylation reaction [3], showing good activity and selectivity. It is interesting to study the effects of these ligands in the aminocarbonylation reaction and to analyze how the electronic properties of these ligands can improve the catalytic activity. Furthermore, these compounds can act as heterobidentated hemilabile ligands, since phosphorus and nitrogen atoms have different affinities …"
3,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of the human population, playing a key role in the origin and progression of malignant and non-malignant diseases. Many attempts have been made to classify EBV according to clinical or epidemiological information; however, these classifications show frequent incongruences. For instance, they use a small subset of genes for sorting strains but fail to consider the enormous genomic variability and abundant recombinant regions present in the EBV genome. These could lead to diversity overestimation, alter the tree topology and misinterpret viral types when classified, therefore, a reliable EBV phylogenetic classification is needed to minimize recombination signals. Recombination events occur 2.5-times more often than mutation events, suggesting that recombination has a much stronger impact than mutation in EBV genomic diversity, detected within common …"

They have anti-cancer properties, through their targeting of several signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms within malignant cells. This review describes the chemical structure diversity of fucoidans and their similarity with other molecules such as glycosaminoglycan, which enable them to participation in diverse biological processes. Furthermore, this review summarizes their influence on the development of metastasis and drug resistance, which are the main obstacles to cure cancer. Finally, this article discusses how fucoidans have been used in clinical trials to evaluate their potential synergy with other anti-cancer therapies."
3,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that emerged in Brazil by late 2014. In the country, two CHIKV foci characterized by the East/Central/South Africa and Asian genotypes, were established in North and Northeast regions. We characterized, by phylogenetic analyses of full and partial genomes, CHIKV from Rio de Janeiro state (2014-2015). These CHIKV strains belong to the Asian genotype, which is the determinant of the current Northern Brazilian focus, even though the genome sequence presents particular single nucleotide variations.

Metastasis in lymph nodes and distant organs indicates poor prognosis; However, the influence of DNA methylation over colorectal metastasis is not well understood. We investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of normal, primary tumour and lymph node metastasis of colon, finding a specific signature of early metastasis, present in primary tumour, that allowed a better understanding of colon cancer spread. In addition, the hypermethylation of FIGN, HTRA3, BDNF, HCN4 and STAC2 could be utilised in primary tumour as biomarkers of colorectal cancer prognosis. Abstract Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease caused by both genetic and epigenetics factors. Analysing DNA methylation changes occurring during colorectal cancer progression and metastasis formation is crucial for the identification of novel epigenetic markers of patient prognosis. Genome-wide methylation sequencing of paired samples of colon (normal adjacent, primary tumour and lymph node metastasis) showed global hypomethylation and CpG island (CGI) hypermethylation of primary tumours compared to normal. In metastasis we observed high global and non-CGI regions methylation, but lower CGI methylation, compared to primary tumours. Gene ontology analysis showed shared biological processes between hypermethylated CGIs in metastasis and primary tumours. After complementary analysis with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, FIGN, HTRA3, BDNF, HCN4 and STAC2 genes were found associated with poor survival …"
3,"Ovarian cancer is a significant cancer-related cause of death in women worldwide. The most used chemotherapeutic regimen is based on carboplatin (CBDCA). However, CBDCA resistance is the main obstacle to a better prognosis. An in vitro drug-resistant cell model would help in the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying this drug-resistance phenomenon. The aim of this study was to characterize cellular and molecular changes of induced CBDCA-resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780. The cell selection strategy used in this study was a dose-per-pulse method using a concentration of 100 μM for 2 h. Once 20 cycles of exposure to the drug were completed, the cell cultures showed a resistant phenotype. Then, the ovarian cancer cell line A2780 was grown with 100 μM of CBDCA (CBDCA-resistant cells) or without CBDCA (parental cells). After, a drug sensitivity assay, morphological analyses, cell death assays and a RNA-seq analysis were performed in CBDCA-resistant A2780 cells. Microscopy on both parental and CBDCA-resistant A2780 cells showed similar characteristics in morphology and F-actin distribution within cells. In cell-death assays, parental A2780 cells showed a significant increase in phosphatidylserine translocation and caspase-3/7 cleavage compared to CBDCA-resistant A2780 cells (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively). Cell viability in parental A2780 cells was significantly decreased compared to CBDCA-resistant A2780 cells (P < 0.0005). The RNA-seq analysis showed 156 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated mainly to molecular functions. CBDCA-resistant A2780 ovarian cancer …"
3," Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has a global spread, and it is estimated that around 20 million persons are infected. Seven major genetic subtypes are recognized. However, there are complete genomes only from the HTLV-1a (cosmopolitan) and HTLV-1c (Melanesian) subtypes. Here, the first full-length genome of an HTLV-1b strain, a subtype so far restricted to Central African countries, is revealed. The genome size of HTLV-1b SF26, a strain isolated in Brazil, was determined to be 8,267 bp. The genomic analysis showed that all characteristic regions and genes of a prototypic HTLV-1 virus are conserved. This genome can provide information for further studies on the evolutionary history and pathogenic potential of this human oncovirus."
3,"The lifetime risk of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) development differs among ethnic groups. To better understand these differences, this prospective cohort study was conducted to investigate the cytokine profile and the HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) in Japanese and non-Japanese populations with HAM/TSP and asymptomatic carriers (ACs). The serum IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-γ levels were quantified using the Cytometric Bead Array in 40 HTLV-1-infected patients (11 HAM/TSP and 29 ACs) and 18 healthy controls (HCs) in Brazil. Among ACs, 15 were Japanese descendants and 14 were non-Japanese. Of 11 patients with HAM/TSP, only one was a Japanese descendant. The HTLV-1 PVL was quantified by real-time PCR. The HTLV-1 PVL was 2.7-fold higher in HAM/TSP patients than ACs. Regardless of the clinical outcome, the PVL was significantly higher in patients younger than 60 years than older patients. The HAM/TSP and ACs had higher IL-10 serum concentrations than that of HCs. The ACs also showed higher IL-6 serum levels than those of HCs. According to age, the IL-10 and IL-6 levels were higher in ACs non-Japanese patients older than 60 years. HAM/TSP patients showed a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-17 and a negative correlation between the PVL and IL-17 and IFN-γ. In the all ACs, a significant positive correlation was observed between IL-2 and IL-17 and a negative correlation was detected between IL-10 and TNF-α. Only 6.25% of the Japanese patients were symptomatic carriers, compared with 41.67% of the non-Japanese patients. In conclusion, this …"

3,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used to treat certain types of non-melanoma skin cancer with promising results. However, some skin lesions have not fully responded to this treatment, suggesting a potential PDT-resistant phenotype. Therefore, novel therapeutic alternatives must be identified that improve PDT in resistant skin cancer. In this study, we analyzed the cell viability, intracellular protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) content and subcellular localization, proliferation profile, cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and relative gene expression in PDT-resistant HSC-1 cells. PDT-resistant HSC-1 cells show a low quantity of protoporphyrin IX and low levels of ROS, and thus a low rate of death cell. Furthermore, the resistant phenotype showed a downregulation of HSPB1, SLC15A2, FECH, SOD2 and an upregulation of HMBS and BIRC5 genes. On the other hand, epigallocatechin gallate catechin enhanced the MAL-PDT effect, increasing levels of protoporphyrin IX and ROS, and killing 100% of resistant cells. The resistant MAL-PDT model of skin cancer squamous cells (HSC-1) is a reliable and useful tool to understand PDT cytotoxicity and cellular response. These resistant cells were successfully sensitized with epigallocatechin gallate catechin. The in vitro epigallocatechin gallate catechin effect as an enhancer of MAL-PDT in resistant cells is promising in the treatment of difficult skin cancer lesions."
3,"DiscussionThis study unequivocally showed the presence of HTLV-2b infection in a case of chronic spastic paraparesis, clinically indistinguishable from HAM/TSP.

3,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a significant cancer-related cause of death worldwide. The most used chemotherapeutic regimen in GC is based on platinum drugs such as cisplatin (CDDP). However, CDDP resistance reduces advanced GC survival. In vitro drug-resistant cell model would help in the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying this drug-resistance phenomenon. The aim of this study was to characterize new models of CDDP-resistant GC cell lines (AGS R-CDDP and MKN-28 R-CDDP) obtained through a stepwise increasing drug doses method, in order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance as well as identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of GC. Cell viability assays, cell death assays and the expression of resistance molecular markers confirmed that AGS R-CDDP and MKN-28 R-CDDP are reliable CDDP-resistant models. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses identified a total of 189 DEGs, including 178 up-regulated genes and 11 down-regulated genes, associated mainly to molecular functions involved in CDDP-resistance. DEGs were enriched in 23 metabolic pathways, among which the most enriched was the inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway. Finally, the higher mRNA expression of SERPINA1, BTC and CCL5, three up-regulated DEGs associated to CDDP resistance found by RNA-seq analysis was confirmed. In summary, this study showed that AGS R-CDDP and MKN-28 R-CDDP are reliable models of CDDP resistance because resemble many of resistant phenotype in GC, being also useful to assess potential therapeutic targets for the …"

3,"Background and Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the salivary microbiome in healthy peri-implant sites and those with peri-implantitis. Methods Saliva samples were collected from 21 participants with healthy peri-implant sites and 21 participants with peri-implantitis. The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using the Ion Torrent PGM System (Ion 318TM Chip v2 400). The NGS analysis and composition of the salivary microbiome was determined by taxonomy assignment. Down-stream bioinformatic analyses were performed in QIIME (v 1.9.1). Results Clinical differences according to peri-implant condition status were found. Alpha diversity metrics revealed that the bacterial communities of participants with healthy peri-implant sites tended to have a richer microbial composition than individuals with peri-implantitis. In terms of beta diversity, bleeding on probing (BoP) may influence the microbial diversity. However, no clear partitioning was noted between the salivary microbiome of volunteers with healthy peri-implant sites or volunteers. with peri-implantitis. The highest relative abundance of Stenotrophomonas, Enterococcus and Leuconostoc genus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Prevotella copri, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides stercoris bacterial species was found in participants with peri-implantitis when compared with those with healthy peri-implant sites. Conclusion Differences in salivary microbiome composition were observed between patients with healthy peri-implant sites and those with peri-implantitis.

3," Simple Summary The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in several human neoplastic diseases. The EBV-1 can transform B cells into LCL more efficiently than EBV-2, and EBV-2 preferentially infects T-cell lymphocytes. The EBNA3A oncoprotein has an essential role in B-cell transformation. The six peptide motifs called nuclear localization signals (NLSs) from EBNA3A ensure nucleocytoplasmic protein trafficking. Multiple NLSs have been suggested to enhance EBNA3 function or different specificities to different cell types; however, a comprehensive assessment of their genetic variability has not been addressed. Our objective was to study the NLSs’ variability and their relationship with EBV types. Based on a comprehensive analysis of over a thousand EBNA3A sequences from different clinical manifestations and geographic locations, we found that EBNA3A from EBV-2 has two of the six NLSs altered, and genetic patterns in the NLSs are associated with EBV-1 and EBV-2. Abstract The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a globally dispersed pathogen involved in several human cancers of B-cell and non-B-cell origin. EBV has been classified into EBV-1 and EBV-2, which have differences in their transformative ability. EBV-1 can transform B-cells into LCL more efficiently than EBV-2, and EBV-2 preferentially infects T-cell lymphocytes. The EBNA3A oncoprotein is a transcriptional regulator of virus and host cell genes, and is required in order to transform B-cells. EBNA3A has six peptide motifs called nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that ensure nucleocytoplasmic protein trafficking. The presence of multiple …"
3,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a globally-spread virus. It is estimated that there are about 5–10 million infected people in the world. HTLV is endemic in Chile, with higher seroprevalence among indigenous people. However, little is known about HTLV-1 genetic diversity, its introduction and dispersion in this country. To gain insights into these issues, a phylogenetic dating analysis was conducted based on Chilean and closed related long terminal repeat sequences. The time tree reconstruction showed that the introduction of HTLV-1aA occurred several times in Chile. It was hypothesized that these introductions took place at least in two different historical moments: (i) during the ancient human migrations and (ii) during/after the European colonization of South America. The present study contributes toward understanding the evolutionary history of HTLV-1 in Chile and South America."
3,"HTLV-1 infects approximately 5-10 millions of individuals in the world and the majority of them remain lifelong asymptomatic carriers (AC). However, up to 5% of HTLV-1 patients may present inflammatory neurological or proliferative disorders as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), respectively. In HAM/TSP, the spinal cord inflammation, leads to a chronic disabling disturbance. In ATL, HTLV induces T-cell proliferation and transformation, with a lethal consequence to the host. 1 High proviral load is associated with disease progression. However, factors that may influence viral replication are unclear. Some viral encoded proteins, such as p12, induces infected T-cell proliferation and stimulates immune evasion. 2-15 Previous studies demonstrated that mutations in p12 may influence the HTLV-1 infection outcome. 3, 5, 8, 16, 17 Here, we identified, at …"
3,"Chemoresistance is a significant clinical challenge, limiting the drug response in cancer. Several mechanisms associated with drug resistance have been characterized, and the role of epigenetics in generating resistance to platinum-based drugs has been clarified. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, long noncoding RNA, and microRNA affect the expression of genes implicated in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of drugs, and other non-ADME genes that encode enzymes involved in the processes of cell proliferation, DNA repair, apoptosis and signal transduction key in the development of chemoresistance in cancer, specifically in platinum-based drugs.

3,"The Ski2-like RNA helicase Brr2 is a core component of the spliceosome that must be tightly regulated to ensure correct timing of spliceosome activation. Little is known about mechanisms of regulation of Ski2-like helicases by protein cofactors. Here we show by crystal structure and biochemical analyses that the Prp8 protein, a major regulator of the spliceosome, can insert its C-terminal tail into Brr2’s RNA-binding tunnel, thereby intermittently blocking Brr2’s RNA-binding, adenosine triphosphatase, and U4/U6 unwinding activities. Inefficient Brr2 repression is the only recognizable phenotype associated with certain retinitis pigmentosa–linked Prp8 mutations that map to its C-terminal tail. Our data show how a Ski2-like RNA helicase can be reversibly inhibited by a protein cofactor that directly competes with RNA substrate binding."

3,"For each round of pre-mRNA splicing, a spliceosome is assembled anew on its substrate. RNA-protein remodeling events required for spliceosome assembly, splicing catalysis, and spliceosome disassembly are driven and controlled by a conserved group of ATPases/RNA helicases. The activities of most of these enzymes are timed by their recruitment to the spliceosome. The Brr2 enzyme, however, which mediates spliceosome catalytic activation, is a stable subunit of the spliceosome, and thus, requires special regulation. Recent structural and functional studies have revealed diverse mechanisms whereby an RNaseH-like and a Jab1/MPN-like domain of the Prp8 protein regulate Brr2 activity during splicing both positively and negatively. Reversible Brr2 inhibition might in part be achieved via an intrinsically unstructured element of the Prp8 Jab1/MPN domain, a concept widespread in biological systems …"

Therefore, the main aim of this study was to develop a food-grade Pickering stabilizer using a protein isolate obtained from the protein-rich lupin variety AluProt-CGNA® (LPIA). Lupin protein aggregate particles (LP-APs), obtained from LPIA, were produced through a facile and scalable technology based on heat-induced particle formation. LP-APs with high surface charge and partial wettability were effective for stabilizing O/W emulsions. These emulsions were prepared by using high-speed homogenization with LP-APs dispersions.

3,"The spliceosome is a very dynamic cellular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) machinery responsible for the removal of non-coding regions (introns) and ligation of coding regions (exons) during pre-mRNA maturation in eukaryotes. Throughout the splicing cycle the spliceosome undergoes major structural rearrangements, especially in the RNA-RNA interaction network. RNA helicases are considered the driving forces in the dynamic remodeling of RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Eight members of the superfamily 2 (SF2) of helicases are present in the spliceosome, the Ski2-like RNA helicase Brr2 being one of them. Brr2 carries out the unwinding of the U4/U6 RNA duplex that is a crucial step for the spliceosome activation. The action of Brr2 ends with the release of the U4 snRNP and thus the U6 snRNA is able to extensively base pair with U2 snRNA, whose interaction is essential for catalysis. Brr2 encounters the U4/U6 di-snRNA early, when U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP is formed. Hence, Brr2 must be tightly regulated to ensure correct timing of spliceosome activation and disassembly. However, Brr2 does not only require inhibition to avoid premature unwinding, but also activation, because this helicase is very inefficient and has to unwind the most stable RNA duplex of the spliceosome. Two protein factors have been observed to modulate Brr2's activity, Prp8 and Snu114. Both proteins, like Brr2, are constitutive members of the U5 snRNP, but only Prp8 showed a direct effect on Brr2's activity. The detailed features of this interaction are unknown. The main goals of this thesis were to learn more about the structural basis that make this …"
